## Respecting the Structure with Natural Transformations

The functor type class maintains context by only operating on the values inside. A natural transformation on the other hand leaves the values untouched and only transforms the context. It is a morphism from one functor to another, while the internal structure of both functors is respected. From a type level perspectice it is a principled transformation from one higher order type constrcutor to another, provided both implement the functor type class:

```javascript
F<A> => G<A> // where F and G are functors
```
What does such a morphism looks like? It is just a function that has to be fully polymorphic in the type argument of the functor, or simply put, it must not transform the values in the functorial context. Let us start with a simple natural transformation from computations with no, one or several values (`Array`) to a computation that may have no result at all (`Option`) and vice versa:

```javascript
// Option type

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});

const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// functors

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));
  
const optMap = f => tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => None,
    Some: ({some: x}) => Some(f(x))
  });
  
// natural transformations

const optArray = tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: () => [],
    Some: ({some}) => [some]
  });
  
const arrOption = xs =>
  xs.length === 0
    ? None
    : Some(xs[0]);

// main

optArray(None); // []
optArray(Some(5)); // [5]

optArray(arrOption([])); // []
optArray(arrOption([5])); // [5]

arrOption([]); // None
arrOption([1, 2, 3]); // Some(1)
```

Transforming from `Option` to `Array` or even conduct several transformations back and forth always yields the same result. However, the `arrOption` morphism from `Array` to `Option` works only with information loss. Arrays on the one hand may contain no, one or several values. `Option` on the other hand may contain no or one value. As a result there are cases where we must pick a single element from the array. In the example above we arbitrarily picked the first one, but we could also have picked the last or any other one.

Depending on the context natural transformations allow operations like combining, picking or even duplicating. Here is another valid implementation of `optArray`:

```javascript
const optArray = tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: () => [],
    Some: ({some}) => [some, some, some]
  });
```
### Incompatible functors

Can we transform any functor into any other one? No, because we have to respect the structure of both functors, which are sometimes incompatible. The next example will illustrate that there are plenty of functors between which no natural transformations exists. See how we fail to create a morphism between asynchronous computations (`Task`) to computations that may not yield a result at all (`Option`):

```javascript
// Task

const Task = task => record(
  Task,
  thisify(o => {
    o.task = (res, rej) =>
      task(x => {
        o.task = k_ => k_(x);
        return res(x);
      }, rej);
    
    return o;
  }));

const delay = f => ms => x =>
  Task((res, rej) => setTimeout(x => res(f(x)), ms, x));

// Option

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});
const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// Functor

const tMap = f => tx =>
  Task((res, rej) => tx.task(x => res(f(x)), rej));

const optMap = f => tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => None,
    Some: ({some: x}) => Some(f(x))
  });

// natural transformations

const optTask = tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: () => Task((res, rej) => rej("oops")),
    Some: ({some}) => Task(res => res(some))
  });

const tOption = tx =>
  tx.task(x => Some(x), _ => None);

// main

const inc = x => x + 1;

tMap(inc) (optTask(None)).task(id, id); // "oops"
tMap(inc) (optTask(Some(5))).task(id)); // 6

optMap(x => x + 1) (tOption(delay(id) (1000) (5))); // type error
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/KhakiOutgoingOop)

The `optTask` transformation from `Option` to `Task` works as expected. `Some` is mapped to the resolve handler of the continuation and `None` to the reject handler. However, there exists no mapping for the opposite case. `tOption` tries to transform an asynchrnous `Task` to an synchronous `Option`. This cannot work, of course, since the computation based on `Option` is already finished when the `Task` computation is about to start.

### Commutativity

Natural transformations are commutative:

```javascript
  map(f) (nt(Some(5))) === nt(map(f) (Some(5)))
//^^^                         ^^^ both map are from different functors
```
This property allows for certain optimizations in your code.

### Simplifying functor stacks

The main use case for natural transformations is to simplify nested functorial structures. For instance, when you have an `Either<Task<Either<E, A>>` functor stack you can often transform the structure to `Either<Task<Task<A, E>>` and then reduce it to `Either<Task<E, A>>` by joining the consecutive inner `Task`s. `join` is a monadic operation and we will learn about monads in a later chapter of this course.
