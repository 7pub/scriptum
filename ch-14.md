## Combining Values: From Semigroup to Monoid

### Semigroup

The semigroup type class is quite simple. It provides a general approach to combine two values using an associative binary operation called `append`. Unlike this names implies semigroup instances can be implemented for a variety of types, not just collections. Appending is therefore to be understood rather metaphorically.

Associativity in the semigroup context guarantees the following property:

```javascript
append(append(a) (b)) (c) === append(a) (append(b) (c))
```
Before we are going to implement a couple of instances of semigroup let me introduce another type class that inherits from semigroup and complements it in a meaningful way.

### Monoid

Monoid adds an identity element to semigroup, i.e. a neutral element that does not have an effect when applied to `append` but leaves the other value unchanged. Why is such an element useful? You could have also asked why zero is useful in arithmetic:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const sumEmpty = ({get fresh() {return 0}});

const prodAppend = x => y => x * y
const prodEmpty = ({get fresh() {return 1}});
```

* combining values
* identity element
* a monoid under adition
* a monoid under multiplication
* the list monoid
* a type class for combining things
* First/Last
* compare
* mconcat
* combine/sequence effects in parallel/sequential
* every effect is performed once
* pure must not perform an effect ata all
* the combination of effects is monoidal
* pure f <*> x = fmap f x defines meaningful combinations of effects
* applicative have a monoidal nature
* Applicative instances must be monoidal in how they sequence their effects
* associative binary operations with an identity
* append is just a metaphor sometimes
* monoid homomorphism
* dual monoid and a append b !== b append a (non-commutative)
* product monoid instance (Monoid a,Monoid b) => Monoid (a,b) where mempty = (mempty,mempty) mappend (u,v) (w,x) = (u `mappend` w,v `mappend` x)
* Monoids provide a general approach to combining and accumulating values
* They allow us to write code that is agnostic about the method we will use to combine values, and that makes our code more reusable
* analogously to how a monoid is a structure that defines a way to combine objects
* an applicative that has a monoid for its type variable is also a monoid
