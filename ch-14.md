## Combining Values: From Semigroup to Monoid

The `Monoid` type class including its Semigroup superclass is besides `Functor` the cornerstone of functional programming. While `Functor` is a basic superclass of many other type classes the relation with `Monoid` is a bit more subtle. As many other type classes `Monoid` represents the notion of combining things, but it is the most general approach with the least contraints.

### Semigroup and appending

The semigroup type class is quite simple. It provides a general approach to combine two values using an associative binary operation called `append`. The `append` function takes two values of the same type and returns a combined value again of the same type. Unlike the name of its binary operation implies semigroup instances can be implemented for a variety of types, not just appendable collections. Appending is therefore to be understood rather metaphorically in many cases.

Associativity in the semigroup context guarantees the following property demonstrated using an instance of natural numbers:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const diffAppend = x => y => x - y

// associative

sumAppend(sumAppend(2) (5)) (10) === sumAppend(2) (sumAppend(5) (10));

// non-associative

diffAppend(diffAppend(2) (5)) (10) !== diffAppend(2) (diffAppend(5) (10));
```
There is a semigroup under addition but none under subtraction.

Before we are going to implement further instances let me introduce another type class that inherits from semigroup and complements it in a useful way.

### Monoid and identity

Monoid adds an identity element to semigroup, i.e. a neutral element that does not have an effect when applied to `append` but leaves the other value unchanged. Why is such an element useful? You could have also asked why zero is useful in arithmetic:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const sumEmpty = ({get fresh() {return 0}});

sumAppend(10) (sumEmpty.fresh); // 10

const prodAppend = x => y => x * y
const prodEmpty = ({get fresh() {return 1}});

prodAppend(10) (sumEmpty.fresh); // 10
```
The `Sum` and `Product` type both form a monoid and hence are both semigroups. The underlying type is actually the natural numbers but to distinguish both monoids we use `Sum`/`Product` as type wrappers. Please note that `sumEmpty`/`prodEmpty` are implemented as lazy getters, because Javascript is not a referential transparent language. This does not matter along with primitive types like numbers but it does have an effect on all reference types, as we will see later in this chapter.

### Type level

### The `List` instance

### The `First`/`Last` instances

### Comparison using monoids

### Non-commutative and dual monoids

### Monoid homomorphisms


* the list monoid
* First/Last
* compare
* mconcat
* monoid homomorphism
* dual monoid and a append b !== b append a (non-commutative)
* product monoid instance (Monoid a,Monoid b) => Monoid (a,b) where mempty = (mempty,mempty) mappend (u,v) (w,x) = (u `mappend` w,v `mappend` x)
* They allow us to write code that is agnostic about the method we will use to combine values, and that makes our code more reusable
