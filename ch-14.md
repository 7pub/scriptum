## Combining Values with Monoid

`Monoid` captures the notion of combining values and lets us write code that is agnostic about the method we will use to combine them. Combining things is one of the most fundamental operations in programming. It can mean accumulating or picking. With `Group` the `Monoid` type class has only a single subclass, but it is as general and significant as `Functor`. Plenty of other type classes encode the notion of accumulating or picking one way or the other.

### Appending with identity

The `Monoid` type class comprises two properties:

```javascript
const append = x => y => ???
const empty = ???;
```
The associative `append` function takes two values of the same type and returns a combined value of the same type all over again. Unlike its name implies there are monoids for a variety of types, not just appendable collections. Appending is to be understood rather metaphorically in many cases. Strictly speaking `append` belongs to `Semigroup`, which is a superclass of `Monoid`.

`Monoid` adds the `empty` property that complements `Semigroup` in a useful way. It represents the identity element, i.e. a neutral element that does not have an effect when applied to `append` but leaves the other value unchanged. Why is such an element useful? You could have also asked why `0` or `1` are useful in arithmetics:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const sumEmpty = ({get fresh() {return 0}});

sumAppend(10) (sumEmpty.fresh); // 10

const prodAppend = x => y => x * y
const prodEmpty = ({get fresh() {return 1}});

prodAppend(10) (sumEmpty.fresh); // 10
```
The `Sum` and `Product` type both form a monoid and hence are both semigroups. The underlying type is in both cases natural numbers but in order to distinguish both monoids we use the `Sum`/`Product` type wrappers. Please note that `sumEmpty`/`prodEmpty` are implemented as lazy getters, because Javascript is not a referential transparent language. This does not matter along with primitive types like numbers but it does have an effect on all reference types, as we will see later in this chapter.

I have already mentioned that the binary operation of our type class is associative, which guarantees the following property:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const diffAppend = x => y => x - y

// associative

sumAppend(sumAppend(2) (5)) (10) === sumAppend(2) (sumAppend(5) (10));

// non-associative

diffAppend(diffAppend(2) (5)) (10) !== diffAppend(2) (diffAppend(5) (10));
```
There is a semigroup under addition but none under subtraction.

### Type level

On the type level a monoid is just a first order type constructor, because in contrast to functor monoid only works on values not values in a context:

```javascript
type append<A> = (_: A) => (_: A) => A;
type empty<A> = {fresh: A}
```
### The `List` instance

### The `First`/`Last` instances

### The `All`/`Any` instances

### Lift a Semigroup into a Monoid

### The `Min`/`Max` instances

### The `Endo` and `Fun` instances

Monoid (Endo a)
Monoid b => Monoid (a -> b)

### The `Equivalence` instance

### The `Compare` instance

### The `Pred` instance

### Commutative monoids and `Dual`

a append b === b append a

### Monoid homomorphisms

### Product monoid

(Monoid a, Monoid b) => Monoid (a, b)
