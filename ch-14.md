## Respecting the Structure with Natural Transformations

The functor type class maintains context by only operating on the values inside. A natural transformation on the other hand leaves the values untouched and only transforms the context. It is a morphism from one functor to another, while the internal structure of both functors is respected.

What does such a morphism looks like? It is just a function that have to be fully polymorphic in the type argument of the functor, or simply put, it must not transform the values in the functorial context. Let us start with a simple natural transformation from computations with no, one or several results (`Array`) to a computation that may have no result at all (`Option`) and vice versa:

```javascript
// Option type

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});

const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// functors

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));
  
const optMap = f => tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => None,
    Some: ({some: x}) => Some(f(x))
  });
  
// natural transformation

const optArray = tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: () => [],
    Some: ({some}) => [some]
  });
  
const arrOption = xs =>
  xs.length === 0
    ? None
    : Some(xs[0]);

// main

optArray(None); // []
optArray(Some(5)); // [5]

optArray(arrOption([])); // []
optArray(arrOption([5])); // [5]

arrOption([]); // None
arrOption([1, 2, 3]); // Some(1)
```

We can transform from `Option` to `Array` or even conduct several transformations back and forth. However, the morphism `arrOption` from `Array` to `Option` works only in a limited way. Arrays on the one hand represent a non-deterministic computation that may contain several values. `Option` on the other hand can only take a single value. As a result we must pick a single element from the array. In the example above we picked the first element, which constitutes a safe `head` function. We could have also picked the last one, for instance.

Depending on the context natural transformations not only allow omitting values but also duplicating them. Here is an alternative implementation of `optArray` of many:

```javascript
const optArray = tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: () => [],
    Some: ({some}) => [some, some, some]
  });
```
The next example will illustrate that there are plenty of functors between which no natural transformations exists. We will create the morphism between asynchronous computations (`Task`) to computations that may not yield a result at all (`Option`):

```javascript
// Task

const Task = task => record(
  Task,
  thisify(o => {
    o.task = (res, rej) =>
      task(x => {
        o.task = k_ => k_(x);
        return res(x);
      }, rej);
    
    return o;
  }));

const delay = f => ms => x =>
  Task((res, rej) => setTimeout(x => res(f(x)), ms, x));

// Option

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});
const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// Functor

const tMap = f => tx =>
  Task((res, rej) => tx.task(x => res(f(x)), rej));

const optMap = f => tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => None,
    Some: ({some: x}) => Some(f(x))
  });

// Natural transformations

const optTask = tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: () => Task((res, rej) => rej("oops")),
    Some: ({some}) => Task(res => res(some))
  });

const tOption = tx =>
  tx.task(x => Some(x), _ => None);

const inc = x => x + 1;

tMap(inc) (optTask(None)).task(id, id); // "oops"
tMap(inc) (optTask(Some(5))).task(id)); // 6

optMap(x => x + 1) (tOption(delay(id) (1000) (5))); // type error
```
