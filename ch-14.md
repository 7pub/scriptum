## Accumulating, Aggregating and Picking with Monoid

`Monoid` captures the notions of accumulating, aggregating and picking values, which all can be subsumed under the broader concept of combining. It lets us write code that is agnostic about the method we will actually use. Monoidal types are ubiquitous: `Sum`, `Prod`, `List`, `Any`/`All`, `First`/`Last`, `Min`/`Max`, predicates, comparison, equivalence etc.

### Appending with identity

The `Monoid` type class comprises two properties:

```javascript
const append = x => y => ???
const empty = ???;
```
The associative `append` function takes two values of the same type and returns a combined value of this type. Appending as a term is a bit too narrow to cover the concept. For that reason you should consider `append` rather metaphorically. `empty` is an identity element, i.e. a neutral element that have no effect when applied to `append` and thus leaves the other value unchanged. Let us fill the gaps with an example:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const sumEmpty = () => 0;

sumAppend(10) (sumEmpty()); // 10

const prodAppend = x => y => x * y
const prodEmpty = () => 1;

prodAppend(10) (sumEmpty()); // 10
```
`append` is more or less self-explanatory. `empty` should also be clear now: `0 + 1 === 1` and `1 * 1 === 1` both do not affect the result of the overall operations. The underlying type of both addition and multiplication are the natural numbers, that is, a single type can have more than one useful monoidal structure. Please note that both monoids represent the accumulating notion of monoidal computations.

Strictly speaking only `empty` is a immediate part of the `Monoid` type class, whereas `append` is inherited by the `Semigroup` superclass. Both type classes complement each other and are so closely connected that we often just talk about monoid though. There are some types that only have a `Semigroup` instance, but we will learn how to lift every semigroup into a monoid in a later section of this chapter.

#### Associativity

I have already mentioned that `append` must be associative in order to render the following two operations equivalent:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const diffAppend = x => y => x - y

// associative

sumAppend(sumAppend(2) (5)) (10) === sumAppend(2) (sumAppend(5) (10));

// non-associative

diffAppend(diffAppend(2) (5)) (10) !== diffAppend(2) (diffAppend(5) (10));
```
Given the example above we can derive that there is a monoid under addition but none under subtraction.

### Type level

At the type level the `Monoid` properties just operate on polymorphic values of the shape `A`. There is no distinction between value and context as `Functor` does with `F<A>`. For monoids a value is just a value without any additional semantics:

```javascript
type append<A> = (_: A) => (_: A) => A;
type empty<A> = () => A;
```
The difference in their types reflect the different notions of computations both type classes capture. Where `Monoid` is about combining values `Functor` is about defining context. Both type classes belong to the most fundamental ones in functional programming and it probably makes a lot of sense to combine their notions to obtain further meaningful ones. As a matter of fact this is exactly what many subclasses of `Functor` do. They form variations of context aware monoids. We will examine these type classes in later chapters of this course.

### The `Array` instance

Arrays in terms of monoids are pretty much self-explanatory:

```javascript
const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const arrPrepend = ys => xs =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const arrEmpty = () => [];

arrAppend([1, 2, 3]) ([4, 5, 6]); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

arrPrepend([1, 2, 3]) ([4, 5, 6]); // [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]

arrAppend([1, 2, 3]) (arrEmpty()); // [1, 2, 3]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/FatalWindingLight)

They represent the aggregating notion of monoidal computations.

### The `Pred` instance

The predicate function instance is a bit more interesting:

```javascript
const record = (type, o) =>
  (o[type.name || type] = type.name || type, o);

const Pred = pred => record(Pred, {pred});

const predAppend = tp => tq =>
  Pred(x => tp.pred(x) && tq.pred(x));

const predEmpty = () => Pred(_ => true);

const numLte_ = y => x => x <= y;

const numGte_ = y => x => x >= y;

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

const numBetween = (x, y) => predAppend(
  Pred(numLte_(y)))
    (Pred(numGte_(x)));

const main = predAppend(
  numBetween(5, 10))
    (Pred(isEven));

main.pred(6); // true
main.pred(7); // false
main.pred(12); // false
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/AggravatingAquamarineSystemadministrator)

A predicate is an unary function wrapped in a `Pred` value to distinguish it from regular functions. Predicates are fixed in the type of their codomain, i.e. they always return a boolean. The `Monoid` instance let us compose simple predicates to build more complex ones. Please note that `Pred` represents the picking notion of monoids.

The `Pred` type seems to be just a simple object wrapper but adds type safety to our code, because we cannot use predicates in lieu of normal functions anymore or use them in a context, where booleans are meant to be combined with the `||` operator. Moreover it makes our code more declarative, because predicates are explicitly denoted.

### Defining multidimensional orderings

#### `Comparator` type

First we declare a comparator type to avoid using Javascript's ordering protocoll `1`/`0`/`-1`. It happens that `Comparator` forms a monoid:

```javascript
const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

const Comparator = union("Comparator");

const LT = Comparator("LT", {valueOf: () => -1});

const EQ = Comparator("EQ", {valueOf: () => 0});

const GT = Comparator("GT", {valueOf: () => 1});

// monoid

const ctorEmpty = () => EQ;

const ctorAppend = tx => ty => 
  match(tx, {
    LT: _ => LT,
    EQ: _ => ty,
    GT: _ => GT
  });
```
#### The `Compare` instance

`Compare` is a binary function type that returns values of type `Comparator`. Since comparators are monoids this means we can combine them to form multidimensional orderings:

```javascript
// Compare type

const Compare = cmp => record(
  Compare,
  {cmp});

// monoid

const cmpEmpty = () => _ => _ => ctorEmpty();

const cmpAppend = tx => ty =>
  Compare(x => y => ctorAppend(tx.cmp(x) (y)) (ty.cmp(x) (y)));

// auxiliary functions

const _let = f => f();

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

// comparator functions

const byNatural = Compare(x => y =>
  x < y ? LT
    : x > y ? GT
    : EQ);

const byEven = Compare(x => y =>
  isEven(x) && !isEven(y) ? GT
    : !isEven(x) && isEven(y) ? LT
    : EQ);

// MAIN

const xs = [4, 8, 2, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1, 7, 0];

xs.sort(
  (x, y) =>
   cmpAppend(byEven)
     (byNatural).cmp(x) (y)); // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8];
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/ImpartialInvolvedProgrammingmacro)

Since `Compare` is also a monoid, we can combine such wrapped functions even though each of them expects two arguments. Ultimately this means we can compose binary functions with a fixed return type. Different variations of composition - this is where functional programming shines.

### Semigroup lifting

There are some types that only form a semigroup but not a monoid. However, we can easily promote such types to monoids using the polymophic `monoidAppend` and `monoidEmpty` operations:

```javascript
// Option type

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});

const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// Semigroup lifting

const monoidAppend = append => tx => ty =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => ty,

    Some: ({some: x}) => match(ty, {
      None: _ => tx,
      Some: ({some: y}) => Some(append(x) (y))
    })
  });

const monoidEmpty = () => None;

// First semigroup

const First = first => record(First, {first});

const fstAppend = tx => ty => tx; 

// auxiliary function

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

// MAIN

const xs = [Some("foo"), Some("bar"), Some("baz")],
  ys = [None, Some("bar"), Some("baz")],
  zs = [];

const main = arrFold(
  monoidAppend(fstAppend))
    (monoidEmpty());

main(xs); // Some("foo")
main(ys); // Some("bar")
main(zs); // None
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/SphericalComplexPrinter)

Clearly `monoidEmpty` plays the role of the missing identity element.

### Commutative monoids and `Dual`

While monoids have to be associative, they are not necessarily commutative, that is, for most `Monoid` instances the following applies:

`append(x) (y) !== append(y) (x)`

Consequently it makes sense to define an operation with flipped arguments. We can achieve this either by manually supplying both operations or by declaring a type that reverses the arguments programmatically:

```javascript
const record = (type, o) =>
  (o[type.name || type] = type.name || type, o);

const Dual = dual => record(Dual, {dual});

const dualAppend = append => tx => ty =>
  Dual(append(ty.dual) (tx.dual));

const dualEmpty = empty => () => Dual(empty());

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);
  
const arrEmpty = () => [];

const arrPrepend = dualAppend(arrAppend);

arrPrepend(
  Dual([1, 2, 3))
    (Dual([4, 5, 6])); // Dual([4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3])
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/HealthyGreenHack)

Obviously, `Dual` adds a certain noise to the calling site. For that reason I prefer the manual approach and declare both `append` and `prepend` operations for each type in the scriptum library.

### Monoid homomorphisms

If we have two types that both are monoids and there exists a function to transform one monoid into the other while the monoidal structure is preserved, this function is called a monoid homomorphism. As we have already learned the monoid structure consists of a binary operation and an identity element. Here are the equations that must hold for both properties. `hom` is the said transformation function:

```javascript
hom(append1(x) (y)) === append2(hom(x)) (hom(y))
hom(empty1) === empty2
```
Let us examine an example that has the above properties and one that does not.

#### `Array`/`Number` under addition

The `length` function is a monoid homomorphism between `Array` and `Number`, namely natural numbers to be more precisely:

```javascript
const arrEmpty = () => [];

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const sumEmpty = () => 0;

const sumAppend = x => y => x + y;

const length = xs => xs.length;

length(arrAppend([1, 2, 3]) ([4, 5])) ===
  sumAppend(length([1, 2, 3])) (length([4, 5])); // true
  
length(arrEmpty()) === sumEmpty(); // true
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/TestyViolentReference)

`length` meets the above criteria and is thus a valid monoid homomorphism.

#### `Task`/`Parallel`

`Task` represents asynchronous computations, which are processed in sequence. Its monoid instance lifts two normal values and combines them within an asynchronous computation using their corresponding monoid operation. The `Monoid` instance looks as follows:

```javascript
const thisify = f => f({});

const comp = f => g => x =>
  f(g(x));

const Task = task => record(
  Task,
  thisify(o => {
    o.task = (res, rej) =>
      task(x => {
        o.task = k => k(x);
        return res(x);
      }, rej);
    
    return o;
  }));

// monoid

const tEmpty = empty =>
  () => Task((res, rej) => res(empty()));

const tAppend = append => tx => ty =>
  Task((res, rej) =>
    tx.task(x =>
      ty.task(y =>
        res(append(x) (y)), rej), rej));
```
`Parallel` represents asynchronous computations, which are processed in parallel. Its monoid instance picks the result value of the faster one of two asynchronous computations. It represents the race monoid so to speak. The `Monoid` instance looks as follows:

```javascript
const Parallel = para => record(
  Parallel,
  thisify(o => {
    o.para = (res, rej) =>
      para(x => {
        o.para = k => k(x);
        return res(x);
      }, rej);
    
    return o;
  }));

const pEmpty = () => Parallel((res, rej) => null);

const pAppend = tx => ty => {
  const guard = (res, rej) => [
    x => (
      isRes || isRej
        ? false
        : (isRes = true, res(x))),
    e =>
        isRes || isRej
          ? false
          : (isRej = true, rej(e))];

  let isRes = false,
    isRej = false;

  return Parallel(
    (res, rej) => {
      tx.para(...guard(res, rej));
      ty.para(...guard(res, rej))
    })
};
```
Can we create an homomorphism between both monoids?

```javascript
const taskPara = tx =>
  Parallel((res, rej) => tx.task(x => res(x), rej));
```
`taskPara` seems to be a promising candidate, but does it preserve the monoidal structure?

```javascript
const delayTask = f => ms => x =>
  Task((res, rej) => setTimeout(comp(res) (f), ms, x));

const delayPara = f => ms => x =>
  Parallel((res, rej) => setTimeout(comp(res) (f), ms, x));

const tInc = delayTask(x => x + 1) (20);

const tSqr = delayTask(x => x * x) (200);

const pInc = delayPara(x => x + 1) (10);

const pSqr = delayPara(x => x * x) (100);

const sumAppend = x => y => x + y;

const sumEmpty = () => 0;

pAppend(
  taskPara(tSqr(5)))
    (taskPara(tInc(5))).para(console.log); // logs 6

taskPara(
  tAppend(sumAppend) (tSqr(5)) (tInc(5))).para(console.log); // logs 31
  
6 === 31; // false, does not preserve the structure
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/SelfreliantPristineMarketing)

No, it does not. `taskPara` is not a monoid homomorphism but just a transformation between `Task` and `Parallel`.

### Several monoids per type

Scriptum uses directory passing style and hence can define several monoid instances per type. Consequently we can spare type wrappers in many cases and just use different prefixes for different instances:

```javascript
const allEmpty = () => true;
const anyEmpty = () => false;

const allAppend = x => y => x && y;
const anyAppend = x => y => x || y;
```
However, for some cases I will still use type wrappers, because it makes the code more declarative and more type safe:

```javascript
const Pred = pred => record(Pred, {pred});

const predEmpty = () => Pred(_ => true);

const predAppend = tp => tq =>
  Pred(x => tp.pred(x) && tq.pred(x));
```
