## Combining Values with Monoid

`Monoid` captures the notion of combining values and lets us write code that is agnostic about the method we will actually use. Aggregating and Picking are two possible ways of this broader concept. Monoidal types are ubiquitous: `Any`/`All`, `First`/`Last`, `Min`/`Max`, predicates, comparison, equivalence etc. The concept is so fundamental that it appears in slightly different forms in various type classes. This relation is not obvious, because in almost all cases there is no subclass-superclass-relation between them.

### Appending with identity

The `Monoid` type class comprises two properties:

```javascript
const append = x => y => ???
const empty = ???;
```
The associative `append` function takes two values of the same type and returns a combined value of this type. Appending as a term is a bit too narrow to cover the concept. For that reason you should understand `append` rather metaphorically. Strictly speaking `append` belongs to the `Semigroup` type class, which is a superclass of `Monoid`. Both comprehend each other and are so closely connected that we often just talk about monoid.

`Monoid` adds the `empty` property that complements `Semigroup` in a useful way. It represents the identity element, i.e. a neutral element that does not have an effect when applied to `append` but leaves the other value unchanged. Why is such an element useful? You could have also asked why `0` or `1` are useful in arithmetics:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const sumEmpty = ({get fresh() {return 0}});

sumAppend(10) (sumEmpty.fresh); // 10

const prodAppend = x => y => x * y
const prodEmpty = ({get fresh() {return 1}});

prodAppend(10) (sumEmpty.fresh); // 10
```
The `Sum` and `Product` type both form a monoid and hence are both semigroups. The underlying type is in both cases natural numbers but in order to distinguish both monoids we use the `Sum`/`Product` type wrappers. Please note that `sumEmpty`/`prodEmpty` are implemented as lazy getters, because Javascript is not a referential transparent language. This does not matter along with primitive types like numbers but it does have an effect on all reference types, as we will see later in this chapter.

I have already mentioned that the binary operation of our type class is associative, which guarantees the following property:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const diffAppend = x => y => x - y

// associative

sumAppend(sumAppend(2) (5)) (10) === sumAppend(2) (sumAppend(5) (10));

// non-associative

diffAppend(diffAppend(2) (5)) (10) !== diffAppend(2) (diffAppend(5) (10));
```
There is a semigroup under addition but none under subtraction.

### Type level

On the type level a monoid is just a first order type constructor, because in contrast to functor monoid only works on values not values in a context:

```javascript
type append<A> = (_: A) => (_: A) => A;
type empty<A> = {fresh: A}
```
### The `List` instance

### The `First`/`Last` instances

### The `All`/`Any` instances

### Lift a Semigroup into a Monoid

### The `Min`/`Max` instances

### The `Endo` and `Fun` instances

Monoid (Endo a)
Monoid b => Monoid (a -> b)

### The `Equivalence` instance

### The `Compare` instance

### The `Pred` instance

### Commutative monoids and `Dual`

a append b === b append a

### Monoid homomorphisms

### Product monoid

(Monoid a, Monoid b) => Monoid (a, b)
