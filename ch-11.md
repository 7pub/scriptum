## Immutability in Languages w/o Purely Functional Data Types

Immutability in a language without purely functional data types is a tough nut. It took me quite some time to explore the advantages and disadvantages and draw a few general conclusions. Here is my shot.

### Why mutability is harmful

Mutability is accompanied by side effects, which pop up throughout your code, also in places where you least expect them. The larger your codebase grows the harder it gets to track them. The side effects I am talking about are race conditions. Even in a single threaded language like Javascript there are mechanisms like the event loop that causes them. The question is why would you burden yourself with this additional layer of complexity?

### Why immutability is useful

Immutability does not magically make complexity disappear. Quite the contrary, it introduces another level of complexity all by itself. However, this kind of complexity can be mastered much better, because it is based on principles better accessible for people than subtle side effects. Hopefully I am able to convince you in the next sections that immutability is worth the hassle.

### Do not deny mutability

Javascript is based on data types that are mutable by design. You may treat them as immutable but at the expense of their efficiency:

```javascript
const take = n => ([x, ...xs]) =>
//                     ^^^^^
  n === 0
    ? []
    : [x].concat(take(n - 1) (xs));
//        ^^^^^^
    
const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1).map((x, i) => x + i);

take(200) (xs); // incredible inefficient
```
Both marked areas of the code are responsible of creating a brand new array for each iteration while just throwing away the previous one. Personally I think the spread/rest syntax and `concat` are among the most harmful operations in Javascript, since they entice developers to use arrays in a quite inefficient way.

So the first and most important lesson is not to deny mutability by attempting to solve everything in an immutable manner as long as you are not operating in a purely functional language.

#### Keep mutations local

We can render the above example more efficient by relying on local mutability:

```javascript
const push = x => xs => (xs.push(x), xs);

const take = n => xs =>
  n < 0
    ? []
    : push(xs[n]) (take(n - 1) (xs));
    
const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1).map((x, i) => x + i);

take(200) (xs); // quite efficient
```
The mutation only takes place inside `take` and is not visible in the parent scope. Such mutations are managable, because race conditions are delimited to the function scope. Contained Race conditions are still a fierce beast, so please stay alert.

#### Copy as a last resort

Sometimes we cannot keep side effects from leaking into the parent scope:

```javascript
const fold = f => acc => xs => {
  const go = i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? acc
      : f(x) (go(i + 1));
      
  return go(0);
};

const toTuple = x => y => [x, y];

const empty = [];

const xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

fold(toTuple) (empty) (xs);
console.log(empty); // logs [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```
We need to copy the whole data structure in such cases. For the given example this just means to put the array literal in a nullary function `const empty = () => []`.

### Reduce the need for immutability

### Persistent data structures

#### Structural sharing

#### Hashed array mapped tries (HAMT)

#### Downsides and use cases
