## Immutability in Languages w/o Purely Functional Data Types

Immutability in a language without purely functional data types is a tough nut. It took me quite some time to explore the advantages and disadvantages and draw a few general conclusions. Here is my shot.

### Why mutability is harmful

Mutability is a side effect that introduces different kinds of errors to your code. The larger your codebase grows the harder it gets to keep track of this error potential. As far as I know we can distinguish two error classes:

* race conditions
* non-idempotence

The first point is simple. Race conditions exist in any language. In single threaded Javascript it is the event loop, which allows asynchronous computations. I use a short example to clarify the second point:

```javascript
const append = xs => ys =>
  (xs.unshift(ys), xs);

const empty = [];

const fold = f => acc => ([x, ...xs]) =>
  x === undefined
    ? acc
    : f(fold(f) (acc) (xs)) (x);
  
const xs = [1,2,3];

const main = fold(append) (empty);

main(xs);
main(xs); // [1,2,3,1,2,3]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/LowQuixoticThing)

The `main` operation is not idempotend and thus yields `[1,2,3,1,2,3]` instead of `[1,2,3]`.

### Why immutability is useful

Immutability does not magically make complexity disappear. Quite the contrary, it introduces another level of complexity all by itself. However, this kind of complexity can be mastered much better, because it is based on principles better accessible for people than subtle side effects. Hopefully I am able to convince you in the next sections that immutability is worth the hassle.

### Do not deny mutations

Javascript is based on data types that are mutable by design. You may treat them as immutable but at the expense of their efficiency:

```javascript
const take = n => ([x, ...xs]) =>
//                     ^^^^^
  n === 0
    ? []
    : [x].concat(take(n - 1) (xs));
//        ^^^^^^
    
const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1).map((x, i) => x + i);

take(200) (xs); // incredible inefficient
```
Both marked areas of the code are responsible of creating a brand new array for each iteration while just throwing away the previous one. Personally I think the spread/rest syntax and `concat` are among the most harmful operations in Javascript, since they entice developers to use arrays in a quite inefficient way.

So the first and most important lesson is not to deny mutability by attempting to solve everything in an immutable manner as long as you are not operating in a purely functional language.

#### Keep mutations local

We can render the above example more efficient by relying on local mutability:

```javascript
const push = x => xs => (xs.push(x), xs);

const take = n => xs =>
  n < 0
    ? []
    : push(xs[n]) (take(n - 1) (xs));
    
const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1).map((x, i) => x + i);

take(200) (xs); // quite efficient
```
The mutation only takes place inside `take` and is not visible in the parent scope. Such mutations are managable, because race conditions are delimited to the function scope. Contained Race conditions are still a fierce beast, so please stay alert.

#### Copy as a last resort

Sometimes we cannot keep side effects from leaking into the parent scope:

```javascript
const fold = f => acc => xs => {
  const go = i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? acc
      : f(x) (go(i + 1));
      
  return go(0);
};

const toTuple = x => y => [x, y];

const empty = [];

const xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

fold(toTuple) (empty) (xs);
console.log(empty); // logs [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```
We need to copy the whole data structure in such cases. For the given example this just means to put the array literal in a nullary function `empty = () => []`.

### Reduce the need for immutability

A frequent scenario where immutability matters is gradual data acquisition. If you query external data, process it and query more external data depending on the results you often face the problem to combine this data in a structure, which is gradually growing. On first sight you can either mutate the given data structure or copy it each time you add information. However, a viable alternative is to create data structures sparately, which maintain data relations structurally by exhibiting the same shape:

```javascript
const foo = {
  keyA: {
    keyB: [1, 2, 3],
    /*...*/
  },
  /*...*/
};

const bar = {
  keyA: {
    keyB: ["a", "b", "c"],
    /*...*/
  },
  /*...*/
};

const baz = {
  keyA: {
    keyB: [true, false, false],
    /*...*/
  },
  /*...*/
};
```
Given this three data structures it is quite easy to retrieve the relation between their data components: `[1, "a", true]`, `[2, "b", false]` and `[3, "c", false]`. This approach works for some scenarios but quickly becomes unmaintainable as soon as the number of necessary mutations grows significantly.

### Immutable objects through functional lenses

Technically plain old Javascript objects are unordered maps based on hash tables. However, you should not use them as dictionaries but rather as plain records, which you can nest to form arbitrarily tree structures.

Nested records have an interesting trait as soon as you access them with functional lenses, which are the functional idiom for combined getters and setters. Hence there is no need for immutable objects, provided we use lenses for get, set, update and delete operations.  Unfortunately lenses are an advanced topic and are only covered by a subsequent chapter of this course.

### Persistent data structures and structural sharing

Persistent data structures gain immutability by maintaining all previous states. When you change such a structure only the portion that is actually altered gets copied, whereas the rest is shared between instances. Since persistent data structures are organized as trees that means only the involved node including its nodes along the root pathe are copied. This technique is referred to as structural sharing and it enables efficient copying.

`Hamt` by the way, the persistent data structure used in this course is based on a hashed array mapped trie (HAMT). Besides `String`s it allows all sorts of types as keys, including `Object`s. It has a pretty straightforward API:

```javascript
Hamt(props)
// takes an object with arbitrary properties
// returns fresh empty Hamt with these extra properties

hamtGet(hamt, k)
// takes a hamt and a key of arbitrary type
// returns the corresponding value

hamtHas(hamt, k)
// takes a hamt and a key
// returns true if the key exists and false otherwise

hamtSet(hamt, props1, props2, k, v)
// takes a hamt, two objects, a key and a value
// returns a new hamt with the value set under the given key

hamtDel(hamt, props, k)
// takes a hamt, an object and a key
// returns a new hamt with the key removed

hamtUpd(hamt, props, k, f)
// takes a hamt, an object, a key and a pure function
// returns a new hamt with the updated value under the given key
```
The principle to modify such a persistent data structure is always the same: A function takes a `Hamt` instance and at least a key and returns a new `Hamt` with the modified key, in which all other keys are shared with previous instances.

#### An immutable array

We can gain a better feeling how to handle persistent data structures by having a glimpse at a specific implementation. Here is an excerpt from the `Iarray` API:

```javascript
const Iarray = Hamt(
  {length: 0, offset: 0});

const iarrCons = x => xs =>
  hamtSet(
    xs,
    {},
    {length: xs.length + 1, offset: xs.offset - 1},
    xs.offset - 1,
    x);

const iarrSnoc = x => xs =>
  hamtSet(
    xs,
    {},
    {length: xs.length + 1, offset: xs.offset},
    xs.length,
    x);

const iarrFold = f => acc => xs => {
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (hamtGet(xs, i + xs.offset), i);

  return acc;
};

const iarrFromArr = arrFold(
  acc => (x, i) =>
    hamtSet(acc, {}, {length: acc.length + 1, offset: 0}, i, x))
      (Iarray);

const iarrToArr = thunk_(() =>
  iarrFold(
    acc => (x, i) => arrSnoc(x) (acc))
      ([]));

const xs = iarrFromArr([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

iarrToArr(iarrCons(0) (xs)); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
iarrToArr(iarrSnoc(6) (xs)); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/MessyGlumHexadecimal)

`cons`/`snoc` are the immutable functional counterparts to `unshift`/`push` from the imperative world. It should be clearer now how the `props` argument of most `Hamt` functions is meant to be used. `hamtSet` expects even two of them, because setting actually consists of two operations, one to add a new key/value pair and another to modify an existing one.

You have probably already seen the biggest downside of `Hamt` and persistent data structures in Javascript in general: They are not native and therefore require a lot of transformations. `Hamt` is a tradeoff between performance gain through immutability on the one hand and performance loss through transformations on the other hand. As a rule of thumb we can state that the benefits outweigh their drawbacks when dealing with large amounts of data.

By the way, did you notice that I had to deal with the _non-idempotence_ error from the first example of this chapter? I wrapped `iarrToArr` in an implicit thunk to keep the operation idempotent. I had to take care of side effects and the errors they cause, because I treat arrays as a mutable data type. The crucial part is `arrSnoc`'s implementation `arrSnoc = x => xs => (xs.push(x), xs)`, which pushes elements onto the `Array`. See what happens if I [remove the implicit thunk](https://repl.it/repls/QuaintStableTests).

Now we are prepared to reimplement the `Array`-based and thus inefficient `take` function from the beginning of this chapter. We implement it with the very same algorithm but along with `Iarray` as its underlying data structure:

```javascript
const arrTake = n => ([x, ...xs]) =>
  n === 0
    ? []
    : [x].concat(arrTake(n - 1) (xs));

const iarrTake = n => xs => {
  const go = ([y, ys], m) =>
    m === 0
      ? Iarray
      : iarrCons(y) (go(iarrUncons(ys), m - 1));

  return go(iarrUncons(xs), n);
};

const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1).map((x, i) => x + i),
  ys = iarrFromArr(xs);

arrTake(200) (xs);
iarrTake(200) (ys); // way more efficient
```
