## Immutability in Languages w/o Purely Functional Data Types

Immutability in a language without purely functional data types is a tough nut. It took me quite some time to explore the advantages and disadvantages and draw a few general conclusions. Here is my shot.

### Why mutability is harmful

Mutability is accompanied by side effects, which pop up throughout your code, also in places where you least expect them. The larger your codebase grows the harder it gets to track them. The side effects I am talking about are race conditions. Even in a single threaded language like Javascript there are mechanisms like the event loop that causes them. The question is why would you burden yourself with this additional layer of complexity?

### Why immutability is useful

Immutability does not magically make complexity disappear. Quite the contrary, it introduces another level of complexity all by itself. However, this kind of complexity can be mastered much better, because it is based on principles better accessible for people than subtle side effects. Hopefully I am able to convince you in the next sections that immutability is worth the hassle.

### Do not deny mutations

Javascript is based on data types that are mutable by design. You may treat them as immutable but at the expense of their efficiency:

```javascript
const take = n => ([x, ...xs]) =>
//                     ^^^^^
  n === 0
    ? []
    : [x].concat(take(n - 1) (xs));
//        ^^^^^^
    
const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1).map((x, i) => x + i);

take(200) (xs); // incredible inefficient
```
Both marked areas of the code are responsible of creating a brand new array for each iteration while just throwing away the previous one. Personally I think the spread/rest syntax and `concat` are among the most harmful operations in Javascript, since they entice developers to use arrays in a quite inefficient way.

So the first and most important lesson is not to deny mutability by attempting to solve everything in an immutable manner as long as you are not operating in a purely functional language.

#### Keep mutations local

We can render the above example more efficient by relying on local mutability:

```javascript
const push = x => xs => (xs.push(x), xs);

const take = n => xs =>
  n < 0
    ? []
    : push(xs[n]) (take(n - 1) (xs));
    
const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1).map((x, i) => x + i);

take(200) (xs); // quite efficient
```
The mutation only takes place inside `take` and is not visible in the parent scope. Such mutations are managable, because race conditions are delimited to the function scope. Contained Race conditions are still a fierce beast, so please stay alert.

#### Copy as a last resort

Sometimes we cannot keep side effects from leaking into the parent scope:

```javascript
const fold = f => acc => xs => {
  const go = i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? acc
      : f(x) (go(i + 1));
      
  return go(0);
};

const toTuple = x => y => [x, y];

const empty = [];

const xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

fold(toTuple) (empty) (xs);
console.log(empty); // logs [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```
We need to copy the whole data structure in such cases. For the given example this just means to put the array literal in a nullary function `empty = () => []`.

### Reduce the need for immutability

A frequent scenario where immutability matters is gradual data acquisition. If you query external data, process it and query more external data depending on the results you often face the problem to combine this data in a structure, which is gradually growing. On first sight you can either mutate the given data structure or copy it each time you add information. However, a viable alternative is to create data structures sparately, which maintain data relations structurally by exhibiting the same shape:

```javascript
const foo = {
  keyA: {
    keyB: [1, 2, 3],
    /*...*/
  },
  /*...*/
};

const bar = {
  keyA: {
    keyB: ["a", "b", "c"],
    /*...*/
  },
  /*...*/
};

const baz = {
  keyA: {
    keyB: [true, false, false],
    /*...*/
  },
  /*...*/
};
```
Given this three data structures it is quite easy to retrieve the relation between their data components: `[1, "a", true]`, `[2, "b", false]` and `[3, "c", false]`. This approach works for some scenarios but quickly becomes unmaintainable as soon as the number of necessary mutations grows significantly.

### Immutable objects through functional lenses

Technically plain old Javascript objects are unordered maps based on hash tables. However, you should not use them as dictionaries but rather as plain records, which you can nest to form arbitrarily tree structures.

Nested records have an interesting trait as soon as you access them with functional lenses, which are the functional idiom for combined getters and setters. Hence there is no need for immutable objects, provided we use lenses for get, set, update and delete operations.  Unfortunately lenses are an advanced topic and are only covered by a subsequent chapter of this course.

### Persistent data structures and structural sharing

Persistent data structures gain immutability by maintaining all previous states. When you change such a structure only the portion that is actually altered gets copied, whereas the rest is shared between instances. Since persistent data structures are organized as trees that means only the involved nodes including their nodes along the root pathes are copied. This technique is referred to as structural sharing. Structural sharing allows for efficient copying.

By the way, the persistent data structure used in this course is based on a hashed array mapped trie (HAMT), which allows all types of keys.

#### Immutable array

`Iarray` is an immutable type based on our HAMT implementation. Working with a concrete implementation hopefully assists you in getting a feeling for immutable types and how they affect your coding. `Iarray` has a pretty straightforward core API:

```javascript
Iarray // empty immutable array similar to []-literal

iarrFromArr(xs) // takes a regular Array and converts it into an immutable one

iarrGet(i) (xs) // takes an index and an Iarray and returns the value stored under the given index

iarrSet(i, x) (xs) // takes an index/value pair and an Iarray and sets the value under the given index

iarrUpd(i, f) (xs) // takes an index/function pair and an Iarray and updates the value under the given index with the result of the function applied to this value

iarrDel(i) (xs) // takes an index and an Iarray and returns a new Iarray with the given index removed

iarrCons(x) (xs) // takes a value and an Iarray and prepends the value at the start of the Iarray

iarrSnoc(x) (xs) // takes a value and an Iarray and appends the value at the end of the Iarray

iarrUncons(xs) // takes in Iarray and returns a pair of the head and tail of the Iarray

iarrUnsnoc(xs) // takes in Iarray and returns a pair of the initial part and the last element of the Iarray
```
Les us use this API to map the core functions of our immutable array type:

```javascript
TODO
```

Now we are prepared to rebuild the `Array` based and thus inefficient function from the beginning of this chapter with a much more efficient version based on our new immutable array:

```javascript
const arrTake = n => ([x, ...xs]) =>
  n === 0
    ? []
    : [x].concat(arrTake(n - 1) (xs));

const iarrTake = n => xs => {
  const go = ([y, ys], m) =>
    m === 0
      ? Iarray
      : iarrCons(y) (go(iarrUncons(ys), m - 1));

  return go(iarrUncons(xs), n);
};

const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1).map((x, i) => x + i),
  ys = iarrFromArr(xs);

arrTake(200) (xs);
iarrTake(200) (ys); // way more efficient
```
