## Immutability in Languages w/o Purely Functional Data Types

Immutability in a language without purely functional data types is a tough nut. It took me quite some time and effort to explore the advantages and disadvantages, draw general conclusions. Here is my shot.

### Reduce the need for immutability

### Persistent data structures

#### Hashed array mapped tries (HAMT)

#### Structural sharing
