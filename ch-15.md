## Statically Combining two Contexts with a Function using Applicative

Functor is an incredible general algebraic structure but it lacks an important capability: It cannot combine the values of two functorial contexts. When we try to apply a functor to a binary function, we wind up with partially applied functions in a context:

```javascript
const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));
  
const add = x => y => x + y;

arrMap(add) ([1, 2, 3]); // [f, f, f]
```
We cannot apply `map` another time, because it expects a pure function `f`, not a list of partially applied functions. Fortunately we can extend the functor type class by to additional operations, which remedy this shortcoming:

### Applicative functor type class

```javascript
const of = x => /* function body */
const ap = tf => tx => /* function body */
```
This is the applicative functor type class, which is a subclass of functor. `ap` takes a lifted function in a context and a value in a context of the same type and applies the function to the value within the context. Since we cannot pass a bare function to `ap`, we must compose it with `map` of the same functor:

```javascript
// functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// applicative functor

const arrAp = fs => xs =>
  xs.reduce((acc, x) => acc.concat(fs.map(f => f(x))), []);

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const add = x => y => x + y;

const xs = [1, 2, 3],
  ys = [10, 100];

comp(arrAp) (arrMap(add)) (xs) (ys); // [11, 12, 13, 101, 102, 103]
//   ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^ applicative pattern
```

`arrAp` composed with `arrMap` is the typical applicative pattern. What `ap` exactly does depends on the context of the underlying functor. With the `Array` functor it creates the cartesian product of the arrays involved.

### Abstract from nesting with applicative lifting

Applicative lifting specialized for the function type might look arbitrarily and useless to you. Believe me it is not. Quite the contrary. It is actually an extremely generalized computational structure, which can be applied to a variety of types. We will learn more about applicative functors in a subsequent chapter of this course. Here is an arity-aware combinator for applicative lifting:

```javascript
const liftA4 = ({map, ap}) => tw => tx => ty => tz => f =>
  ap(ap(ap(map(f) (tw)) (tx)) (ty)) (tz);

const funMap = f => mg =>
  x => f(mg(x));

const funAp = mf => mg =>
  x => mf(x) (mg(x));

const sqr = x => x * x;
const div = x => y => x / y;

const main = liftA4({map: funMap, ap: funAp}) (sqr) (sqr) (sqr) (div(10))
  (w => x => y => z => [w, x, y, z]);

main(2)); // [4, 4, 4, 5]
main(0)); // [0, 0, 0, Infinity]
```

The underlying computational structure of this encoding is the same as in the previous section about function composition: `f(g(x) (y)) (z)`. It works but the second result looks like a type error. We want to avoid `Infinity` and rather return an empty array in this case. However, we cannot short circuit `liftA4`, because its underlying computational structure `f(g(x) (y)) (z)` is static. The shape of a static computational structure must eb known upfront and cannot be altered dynamically depending on values evaluated during runtime.

* a applictive functor is a functor
* apply lifted function in a context
* the machanism is rather mechanic
* since the lifted function is within the context it is sort of object of the context
* the lifted function is applied to the values within the context through the context
* the application of the lifted function is completely determined by the rules and strucuture of the context
* applicative can apply several functorial arguments of the same functor to a pure function
* applicative preserves the product, because a multi-argument functions forms a product type
* to do so we need a morphism for multiplication `ap` and for unit `pure`
* useful for sequencing of actions/effects
* applicatives compose
* applicatives provide a way to take two computations and join them together using a function
* can process two computations in parallel
* combine two effectful values into one using a pure function
* applicative effect order is determined at compile/interpretation time
* applicative combined effects according to a fixed recipe
* with applicative the order of effects must be known in advance
* distinction between the notion of an expression as a value or as a computation
* since applicative doesn't depend on the the previous value, it can be processed in parallel
* combine/sequence effects in parallel/sequential
* every effect is performed once
* pure must not perform an effect ata all
* the combination of effects is monoidal
* pure f <*> x = fmap f x defines meaningful combinations of effects
* applicative have a monoidal nature
* Applicative instances must be monoidal in how they sequence their effects
* associative binary operations with an identity
* combine/sequence effects in parallel/sequential
* every effect is performed once
* pure must not perform an effect ata all
* the combination of effects is monoidal
* pure f <*> x = fmap f x defines meaningful combinations of effects
* applicative have a monoidal nature
* Applicative instances must be monoidal in how they sequence their effects
* associative binary operations with an identity
* an applicative that has a monoid for its type variable is also a monoid
