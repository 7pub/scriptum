## Mechanically Combining Contexts with a Pure Function using Applicative

Functor is an incredible general and useful algebraic structure but it lacks an important capability: We cannot lift a binary or other n-ary functions into several functorial contexts. When we try anyway we get stuck with funcions in this very context:

```javascript
const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));
  
const add = x => y => x + y;

arrMap(add) ([1, 2, 3]); // [f, f, f]
```
`Functor` has no means to further apply these functions, because `map` expects a single pure function not partially applied pure functions within a functorial context. Do you recall the `Monoid` type class? We need a similar algebraic structure but instead of combining values its operation must combine contexts.

### Applicative functor type class

Let us extend the `Functor` type class by declaring a subclass with two additional properties, which resemble the `Monoid` type class:

```javascript
const of = x => /* function body */
const ap = tf => tx => /* function body */
```
`of` acts like an identity context. It puts a value in the most minimal context available. `ap` is a left-associative binary operation to combine two contexts. As its first argument it expects a partially applied function `f` in a context of type `T`, that is, the initial value `x` is already applied to `f`. As its second argument it expects another value `y` within `T`. `ap` applies `f` to `y` within `T` and returns `T` containing the return value.

The applicative principle is limited to contexts of the same type but not to two contexts. We can compose several `ap` operations to lift a pure n-ary function `f` into `n` contexts of the same type, where `f` can combine `m` values. The distinction between `n` and `m` is important here, because their may be no, exactly one or many values within a context. The quantity depends on, well, the respective context.

 

* applicative functor pattern: map-ap composition
* applicative means combining two values into one considering the rules of the context using a pure function 
* the combination of effects is monoidal, i.e. applicative has a monoidal nature
* applicative instances must be monoidal in how they sequence their effects
* an applicative that has a monoid for its type variable is also a monoid
* pure function is object to the combination (is being applied to a value by the context within the context)
* combining means usually sequencing of contexts/effects of the same functor/type unless the context sais otherwise
* application is solely determined by the computational structure, it is a mechanic process
* applicative effect order is usually determined at compile time unless the context sais otherwise
* with applicative the order of effects must be known in advance unless the context sais otherwise
* applicative type class properties/operations (associative binary operations with an identity like monoid)
* applicatives compose
* applicative `ap` is left-associative
* applicative is a semantics machine, it turns a pair tuple into a stateful computation
* with applicative you must distinct between the notion of an expression as a value and as a functorial computation
* as opposed to monad every effect is performed exactly once and pure must not perform an effect at all
* as opposed to monad applicative cannot depend on the result of the previous computation

* applicative preserves the product, because a multi-argument functions forms a product type
* to do so we need a morphism for multiplication `ap` and for unit `pure`

### Applicative functor type class


```javascript
// functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// applicative functor

const arrAp = fs => xs =>
  xs.reduce((acc, x) => acc.concat(fs.map(f => f(x))), []);

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const add = x => y => x + y;

const xs = [1, 2, 3],
  ys = [10, 100];

comp(arrAp) (arrMap(add)) (xs) (ys); // [11, 12, 13, 101, 102, 103]
//   ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^ applicative pattern
```

`arrAp` composed with `arrMap` is the typical applicative pattern. What `ap` exactly does depends on the context of the underlying functor. With the `Array` functor it creates the cartesian product of the arrays involved.

### Abstract from nesting with applicative lifting

Applicative lifting specialized for the function type might look arbitrarily and useless to you. Believe me it is not. Quite the contrary. It is actually an extremely generalized computational structure, which can be applied to a variety of types. We will learn more about applicative functors in a subsequent chapter of this course. Here is an arity-aware combinator for applicative lifting:

```javascript
const liftA4 = ({map, ap}) => tw => tx => ty => tz => f =>
  ap(ap(ap(map(f) (tw)) (tx)) (ty)) (tz);

const funMap = f => mg =>
  x => f(mg(x));

const funAp = mf => mg =>
  x => mf(x) (mg(x));

const sqr = x => x * x;
const div = x => y => x / y;

const main = liftA4({map: funMap, ap: funAp}) (sqr) (sqr) (sqr) (div(10))
  (w => x => y => z => [w, x, y, z]);

main(2)); // [4, 4, 4, 5]
main(0)); // [0, 0, 0, Infinity]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/UnselfishSneakyConditions)

The underlying computational structure of this encoding is the same as in the previous section about function composition: `f(g(x) (y)) (z)`. It works but the second result looks like a type error. We want to avoid `Infinity` and rather return an empty array in this case. However, we cannot short circuit `liftA4`, because its underlying computational structure `f(g(x) (y)) (z)` is static. The shape of a static computational structure must eb known upfront and cannot be altered dynamically depending on values evaluated during runtime.
