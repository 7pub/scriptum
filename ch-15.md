## Combining two Contexts with a Function Through Applicative

Functor is an incredible general algebraic structure but it lacks an important capability: Functor cannot combine the values of two contexts. If we try to apply a functor to a binary function, we wind up with partially applied functions in a context:

```javascript
const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));
  
const add = x => y => x + y;

arrMap(add) ([1, 2, 3]); // [f, f, f]
```
We cannot apply `map` another time, because it expects a pure function `f`, not a list of partially applied functions. Fortunately we can extend the functor type class by to additional operations, which remedy this shortcoming:

```javascript
const of = x => /* function body */
const ap = tf => tx => /* function body */
```
This is the applicative functor type class, which is a subclass of functor. `ap` takes a lifted function in a context and a value in a context of the same type and applies the function to the value within the context. Since we cannot pass bare function to `ap`, we must compose it with `map` of the same functor:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const map = f => tx => /* function body */
const ap = tf => tx => /* function body */

const add = x => y => x + y;

const xs = [1, 2, 3],
  ys = [4, 5, 6

comp(ap) (map(add) (xs)) (ys);
```

* a applictive functor is a functor
* apply lifted function in a context
* the machanism is rather mechanic
* since the lifted function is within the context it is sort of object of the context
* the lifted function is applied to the values within the context through the context
* the application of the lifted function is completely determined by the rules and strucuture of the context
* applicative can apply several functorial arguments of the same functor to a pure function
* applicative preserves the product, because a multi-argument functions forms a product type
* to do so we need a morphism for multiplication `ap` and for unit `pure`
* useful for sequencing of actions/effects
* applicatives compose
* applicatives provide a way to take two computations and join them together using a function
* can process two computations in parallel
* combine two effectful values into one using a pure function
* applicative effect order is determined at compile/interpretation time
* applicative combined effects according to a fixed recipe
* with applicative the order of effects must be known in advance
* distinction between the notion of an expression as a value or as a computation
* since applicative doesn't depend on the the previous value, it can be processed in parallel
