## Mechanically Combining Contexts with a Pure Function using Applicative

Functor is an incredible general and useful algebraic structure but it lacks an important ability: We cannot lift a binary or other n-ary functions into `n` functorial contexts. When we try anyway we get stuck with funcions in a context:

```javascript
const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));
  
const add = x => y => x + y;

arrMap(add) ([1, 2, 3]); // [f, f, f]
```
`Functor` has no means to further apply these functions, because `map` expects a single pure function not partially applied pure functions within a functorial context. Do you recall the `Monoid` type class? We need a similar algebraic structure but instead of combining values its operation must combine contexts.

### Extending functor to applicative

Let us extend the `Functor` type class by declaring a subclass with two additional properties, which resemble the `Monoid` type class:

```javascript
const of = x => /* function body */;
const ap = tf => tx => /* function body */;
```
`of` acts like an identity context. It puts whatever value in the most minimal available context. `ap` is a left-associative binary operation to combine two contexts. As its first argument it expects a partially applied function `f` in a context `F`, that is, the initial value `x` is already applied to `f`. As its second argument it expects another value `y` within `F`. `ap` applies `f` to `y` within `F` and returns another `F` containing the return value.

The applicative principle is limited to contexts of the same type but not to two contexts. We can compose several `ap` operations to lift a pure n-ary function `f` into `n` contexts, where `f` can combine `m` values. The distinction between `n` and `m` is important here, because their may be no, exactly one or many values within a context. The quantity depends on, well, the respective context.

`of` and `ap` do not operate on values but solely on contexts. It is the responsibility of the lifted pure function to transform and combine values contained in these contexts. Therefore you can consider the `Applicative` type class as a monoid in terms of various contexts. A monoid combines values, which may mean accumulating, aggregating or picking. An applicative accumulates, aggregates or picks contexts.

The pure function `f` on the other hand is not context aware at all. The context in which it is being applied to values is completely opaque to `f`. The pure function is exposed to this context and cannot change any property that belongs to the latter. From the perspective of the context `f`'s application is completely mechanic and deterministic.

### The two notions of expressions

When we look at an expression like `[1, [2, [3, []]]]` (single linked `List` type) we can consider it as a collection of values of the same type. This is the notion of an expression as a value. But as soon as we use it as part of a functorial application, the functor turns the mere value `[1, [2, [3, []]]]` into a prioritized choice. This is the notion of an expression as a computation. It is the role of `ap` to combine two prioritized choices into a single one. The lifted pure function may transform the numbers inside `[1, [2, [3, []]]]`, but it cannot interfere with the choice itself, that is, it cannot add, drop or duplicate values, because that would alter the choice and thus the context.

### The mechanical part of applicative

The crucial aspect of applicatives results from the combination of contexts. Each effect the context has on its values is performed exactly ONCE, without exception. Let us illustrate this mechanism using a simple example with arrays:

```javascript
// Functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// Applicative

const arrAp = tf => tx =>
  arrFold(acc => f =>
    arrAppend(acc)
      (arrMap(x => f(x)) (tx)))
        ([])
          (tf);

// Foldable

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

// Semigroup

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

// function compostion

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

// MAIN

const add = x => y => x + y;

const xs = [1, 2, 3],
  ys = [0, 20, 300];

comp(arrAp)
  (arrMap(add))
    (xs)
      (ys); // [1, 21, 301, 2, 22, 302, 3, 23, 303]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/HotpinkShamelessLoopfusion)

We start with two arrays and combine them with a binary function. First we map over `[1, 2, 3]` and than we apply the resuling `[f, f, f]` structure along with the second array to `ap`. This `ap(map(f))` composition is sometime referred to as the applicative pattern and is quite common in functional programming.

The part that makes the applicative computation mechanical is the shape of the resulting structure `[1, 21, 301, 2, 22, 302, 3, 23, 303]`. No matter what we do we cannot change its size, which solely depends on the two input arrays. Why just the size? Because this is the effect the array context has on its values. Arrays in the context of functors are not just collections of values but represent a non-deterministic computation, i.e. they can include none, one or many values. With applicative we do not have any influence on the number of values of the resulting array.

The effect a context can have on its value(s) is not limited to the number of resulting values. Every context has its own effect, often rather subtle ones. This is the property that renders applicative functors so general and hard to grasp. If you understood a specific applicative you are far from having understood all applicatives. It is hard to draw a general conclusion from a specific applicative instance, because the contexts of different instances are often quite different and often have nothing in common.

In order to have a more formal definition of our observation we can recapitulate that applicative is deterministic regarding its context, that is, you can tell the final shape of the context from just lookting at the code.

### The static structure of applicative computations

```javascript
const liftA4 = ({map, ap}) => f => tw => tx => ty => tz =>
  ap(ap(ap(map(f) (tw)) (tx)) (ty)) (tz);

const infix4 = (v, f, w, g, x, h, y, i, z) =>
  i(h(g(f(v) (w)) (x)) (y)) (z);
```
### Combining contexts is more than sequencing

### Function instance

### `Option` instance

### `Task`/`Parallel` instances

### Applicatives compose


* show the static structure of applicative computations
* the lifted pure function is not aware of `ap` but a monadic action is
* a monadic action creates its own context and thus is the context or at least part of the context.
* a lifted pure function is neither aware of `<$>`/`<*>` nor of the context
* an action is aware of both `>>=` and the context, because it controls `>>=` and creates its own context as its result value
* applicative is deterministic in terms of context
* monad is non-deterministic in terms of context
* an applicative that has a monoid for its type variable is also a monoid
* pure function is object to the combination (is being applied to a value by the context within the context)
* combining means usually sequencing of contexts/effects of the same functor/type unless the context sais otherwise
* application is solely determined by the computational structure, it is a mechanic process
* applicative effect order is usually determined at compile time unless the context sais otherwise
* with applicative the order of effects must be known in advance unless the context sais otherwise
* applicative is a semantics machine, it turns a pair tuple into a stateful computation
* as opposed to monad every effect is performed exactly once and pure must not perform an effect at all
* as opposed to monad applicative cannot depend on the result of the previous computation

* applicative preserves the product, because a multi-argument functions forms a product type
* to do so we need a morphism for multiplication `ap` and for unit `pure`

### Applicative functor type class


```javascript
// functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// applicative functor

const arrAp = fs => xs =>
  xs.reduce((acc, x) => acc.concat(fs.map(f => f(x))), []);

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const add = x => y => x + y;

const xs = [1, 2, 3],
  ys = [10, 100];

comp(arrAp) (arrMap(add)) (xs) (ys); // [11, 12, 13, 101, 102, 103]
//   ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^ applicative pattern
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/SpringgreenMajesticInterfaces)

`arrAp` composed with `arrMap` is the typical applicative pattern. What `ap` exactly does depends on the context of the underlying functor. With the `Array` functor it creates the cartesian product of the arrays involved.

### Abstract from nesting with applicative lifting

Applicative lifting specialized for the function type might look arbitrarily and useless to you. Believe me it is not. Quite the contrary. It is actually an extremely generalized computational structure, which can be applied to a variety of types. We will learn more about applicative functors in a subsequent chapter of this course. Here is an arity-aware combinator for applicative lifting:

```javascript
const liftA4 = ({map, ap}) => tw => tx => ty => tz => f =>
  ap(ap(ap(map(f) (tw)) (tx)) (ty)) (tz);

const funMap = f => mg =>
  x => f(mg(x));

const funAp = mf => mg =>
  x => mf(x) (mg(x));

const sqr = x => x * x;
const div = x => y => x / y;

const main = liftA4({map: funMap, ap: funAp}) (sqr) (sqr) (sqr) (div(10))
  (w => x => y => z => [w, x, y, z]);

main(2)); // [4, 4, 4, 5]
main(0)); // [0, 0, 0, Infinity]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/UnselfishSneakyConditions)

The underlying computational structure of this encoding is the same as in the previous section about function composition: `f(g(x) (y)) (z)`. It works but the second result looks like a type error. We want to avoid `Infinity` and rather return an empty array in this case. However, we cannot short circuit `liftA4`, because its underlying computational structure `f(g(x) (y)) (z)` is static. The shape of a static computational structure must eb known upfront and cannot be altered dynamically depending on values evaluated during runtime.
