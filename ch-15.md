## Combining two Contexts with a function through Applicative

* a applictive functor is a functor
* apply lifted function in a context
* the machanism is rather mechanic
* since the lifted function is within the context it is sort of object of the context
* the lifted function is applied to the values within the context through the context
* the application of the lifted function is completely determined by the rules and strucuture of the context
* applicative can apply several functorial arguments of the same functor to a pure function
* applicative preserves the product, because a multi-argument functions forms a product type
* to do so we need a morphism for multiplication `ap` and for unit `pure`
* useful for sequencing of actions/effects
* applicatives compose
* applicatives provide a way to take two computations and join them together using a function
* can process two computations in parallel
* combine two effectful values into one using a pure function
* applicative effect order is determined at compile/interpretation time
* applicative combined effects according to a fixed recipe
* with applicative the order of effects must be known in advance
* distinction between the notion of an expression as a value or as a computation
