## Lifting Pure Functions with Functors

* what are typeclasses and how can they be implemented in Javasscript
* the mother of all typeclasses (almost)
* hard to understand because they are so general
* container is too narrow an explanation
* lifting into a context fits better
* what is a context: priorized choice, asynchronous, stateful, environment, failure
* two major cointext classes: structure and effect
* a type can comprise several contexts
* functors are composable
* type level vs term level
* parameterized type constructor
* context preserving
* simple API: map
* the name comes from the function mapping a -> b to f a -> f b
* functor laws
