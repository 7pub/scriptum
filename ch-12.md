## Lifting Pure Functions with Functors

A functor is a rather simple thing. The characteristic that renders it so elusive is its generality. Numerous very different data types can implement it.

### Definition

A functor in the context of functional programming is an algebraic structure that has the following traits:

* it is an unary type constructor
* it is associated with a binary operation called map
* map must abide by the functor laws

In the next sections I will explain each of the above terms in a comprehensible way so that you are able to understand the concept sufficiently. I need to give some background information before I can get to the heart of the matter. Please bear with me.

### A little type theory

#### Types and values

What is a type in a dynamically typed language? Strictly speaking there is only a single huge union type in Javascript, which comprises all built-in types. Every value can become one of those variants. Simply put the strucutre of a value constitutes a type in Javascript. Pleae note that I will use Typescript notation to denote types:

```javascript
const foo = {foo: 123}; // {foo: number}

const bar = new Set(["bar"]); // Set<string>

const id = x => x; id("baz"); // <string>(x: string) => string

const _true = true; // boolean

const _null = null; // null
```
Each type can be inhabited by either no value at all (`undefined`), one value (`null`) or any number of values.

#### Type and value constructors

A type constructor is like a function on the type level: It needs at least one type to become one itself:

```javascript
const Foo = x => {foo: x}; // <A>(x: A) => {foo: A}

const Bar = xs => new Set(xs); // <A>(xs: A[]) => Set<A>

const id = x => x; // <A>(x: A) => A
```

* what is an algebraic structure
* what is a type in JS
* what are typeclasses and how can they be implemented in Javasscript
* the mother of all typeclasses (almost)
* hard to understand because they are so general
* container is too narrow an explanation
* lifting into a context fits better
* what is a context: priorized choice, asynchronous, stateful, environment, failure
* two major cointext classes: structure and effect
* a type can comprise several contexts
* functors are composable
* type level vs term level
* parameterized type constructor
* context preserving
* simple API: map
* the name comes from the function mapping a -> b to f a -> f b
* functor laws
