## A Little Type Theory

Even though the first part of this course is kept untyped, we need type theory knowledge to understand the chapters to come. Please note that I will use Typescript notation to denote types.

### Structural versus nominal type system

Two major type systems can be distinguished. A structural type system determines type equality and compatibility by the type's actual structure. A type `B` is considered a subtype of another type `A` if `B` contains extra properties in addition to `A`'s ones:

```javascript
type foo = {x: number};
type bar = {x: number};
type baz = {x: number, y: string};

const foo: foo = {x: 2};
const bar: bar = {x: 3};
const baz: baz = {x: 4 , y: "abc"};

const addObj = (o: foo) => (p: foo) =>
  foo.x + foo.x;

// foo and bar are equal types
addObj(foo) (bar);

// foo and baz are compatible types because baz is a subtype of foo
addObj(foo) (baz);
```
A nominal type system on the other hand determines type equality and compatibility based on names. In such a type system only the application `addObj(foo) (foo)` would type check.

Typescript is nominally typed for classes and otherwise structurally typed.

### Values and types

Every programming language has values and every value has a type:

```javascript
undefined // undefined

null // null

true // boolean

123 // number

[1, 2, 3] // number[]

new Set(["abc"]) // Set<string>

{foo: [1, 2, 3]} // {foo: number[]}

const map = f => xs => xs.map(f);
const len = xs => xs.length;

map(len) (["b", "ba", "bar"]) // <string, number>(f: (x: string) => number) => (xs: string[]) => number[]
```
A type can be inhabited by either no value at all (`undefined`), one value (`null`) or any number of values. Since `undefined` indicates a type error in Javascript, we pretend it has no value.

### Value and type constructors

A value constructor takes zero or more values and returns a new value. It lives at the term level of the language. In Javascript there is no difference between a value constructor and a normal function. However, in other more advanced functional languages there is. A value constructor that takes no argument is just a typed constant.

A type constructor takes zero or more types and returns a new type. It lives at the type level of the language. A type constructor that takes no types is just an ordinary type itself. In the following example value constructors with increasing complexity along with their type constructors denoted as comments are listed. Later in this chapter we will see a custom tagged union type, which makes the distinction between type und value constructors clearer:

```javascript
null // null

true // boolean

false // boolean

Array // A[]

Set // Set<A>

// custom data declarations

type Foo = <A>(xs: A[]) => ({ foo: A[] });
const Foo: Foo = xs => ({foo: xs});

interface NonEmpty<A> extends Array<A> {
  (x: A): [A]
}

class NonEmpty<A> extends Array<A> {
    constructor(x: A) {super(x)}
};

```
`null` is both a nullary type constructor (or just a type) and a nullary value constructor (or a typed constant). The type is only inhabited by a single value. `true`/`false` are also typed constants, but their type `boolean` is inhabited by two values.

`A[]` is a type constructor, because it needs a type (e.g. `string`) to create a new type (`string[]`). `Array` is a value constructor, because it needs a value (e.g. `"foo"`) to create a new value (`["foo"]`).

In Javascript the only way to create custom types is to declare a new `Object` type, either by using object factories (`Foo`) or by subclassing (`NonEmpty`).

If a value constructor takes more than one value, the associated type is a product type:

```javascript
type Pair = <A, B>(x: A, y: B) => [A, B]; // type constructor
const Pair: Pair = (x, y) => [x, y]; // value constructor
```
 If a type constructor is associated with more than one value constructor, the underlying type is a sum type:
 
```javascript
const True = {tag: "True"} as const
const False = {tag: "False"} as const;

type Bool = typeof True | typeof False; // two value constructors
```
A tagged union is an alternate way to declare the boolean type. Unfortunately Typescript is quite verbose regarding the declaration of such types. Here is the Haskell counterpart: `data Bool = False | True`.

Another data declaration of a functional linked list comprises an unary type constructor as well as a nullary and an unary value constructor. Besides it is a recursive type definition, because `List<A>` occurs in the body of `Cons`:

```javascript
const Nil = {tag: "Nil"} as const
const Cons = <A>(head: A) => (tail: List<A>) => ({tag: "Cons", head, tail} as const);

type List<A> = typeof Nil | typeof Cons;
```
### Higher-order type constructors

Just as functions can take other functions as arguments at the term level, type constructors can take other type constructors as parameters at the type level. In type theory parlance this is also referred to as higher-kinded types.

Taking the list type from the last example `List<A>` we can transform it into a higher-order one by abstracting from the `List` part: `T<A>`. This new type constructor has two parameters, one for a first-order type constructor (e.g. `List<A>`) and another for a type, which is then fed to this first-order type constrcutor. That means we abstracted from the type constructor by making it polymorphic as well. Such a generalized type constructor is applicable to a wider range of data structures, that is, we only need a single type definition to cover numerous concrete data structures implementing this type.

Unfortunately, such higher-order type constructors cannot be natively expressed in Typescript. There are rather complex workarounds available, but personally I think they establish too great an indirection.

### Parametric polymorphism

Parametric polymorphism is a powerful but also somewhat limited form of polymorphism. The basic idea is that a function or value constructor must not know anything about its parametric polymorphic arguments, that is, they can be of any type. The only valid fully parametric polymorphic first order function is identity `<A>(x: A): A => x`. The concept is far more useful along with higher order functions and enables elegant and concise types:

```javascript
type arrMap = <A, B>(f: (x: A) => B) => (xs: A[]) => B[]
const arrMap: arrMap = f => xs => xs.map(f);
```
### Ad-hoc polymorphism

As opposed to parametric polymorphism ad-hoc polymorphic functions know certain aspects of their polymorphic arguments. You can obtain ad-hoc polymorphism by name overloading or by defining type classes. Name overloading allows a function to be applied to arguments of different type, because there are several distinct implementations under the same name.

Type class polymorphism goes beyond name overloading by additionally establishing relations between overloaded names. For instance, several of them can be grouped together, so that a type only obtains a valid type class instance by implementing all of them. Another example is a overloaded function that is not part of a type class but includes it as a constraint and is thus only valid for types that implement this very type class.

In this course I will realize ad-hoc polymorphism through type classes. Since Javascript does not support them at the language level, I resort to dictionary passing style. Type dictionaries are basically explicit type classes. They are less convenient to handle but equally expressive. Additionally they lead to types, which can be better expressed with the means of Typescript.

### Subtype polymorphism

Subtyping defines a subtype-supertype relationship between two types. This form of polymorphism is widely used in object-oriented programming. Various multi-paradigm languages with strong roots in functional programming incorporate different forms of subtype polymorphism in their type systems. However, in this course we will not engage any further with this topic.

### Row polymorphism

Row polymorphism enables record types to be polymorphic in their fields. Such a type accepts records with more fields than it has declared itself, provided these extra fields coincide for all involved records:

```javascript
type foo = { first: string, last: string };

const o = { first: "Foo", last: "Oof", age: 30 };
const p = { first: "Bar", last: "Rab", age: 45 };
const q = { first: "Baz", last: "Zab", gender: "m" };

const foo = <T extends foo>(o: T) => (p: T) =>
  `${o.first} ${o.last}`;

foo(o) (p); // type checks
foo(o) (q); // type error
```
This form of record field polymorphism entails stronger guarantees than native structural subtyping in languages like Typescript.

### Type classes through dictionary passing style (DPS)

The good thing about dictionary passing style is how simple it is. A type dictionary is just an additional argument containing one or more functions and/or values. It is defined as the first formal parameter of a function and passed as an object to avoid a specific order:

```javascript
// ad-hoc polymorphic function

const foldMap = ({fold, append, empty}) => f =>
  fold(comp2nd(append) (f)) (empty.fresh);

// array instances

const arrFold = f => acc => xs => {
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

// number instances

const add = x => y => x + y;

const addEmpty =
  {get fresh() {return 0}};

// auxiliary functions

const comp2nd = f => g => x => y =>
  f(x) (g(y));
  
const sqr = x => x * x;
  
// MAIN

const xs = [1, 2, 3];

foldMap(
  {fold: arrFold, append: add, empty: addEmpty})
    (sqr)
      (xs); // 14
```

I will show more examples in DPS while introducing common type classes in subsequent chapters of this course. In the second part of this course, which engages in typed functional programming, we will see what simple types emerge from DPS. Apart from that we will explore how type dictionaries must be enhanced in order to allow multi-parameter type classes and functional dependencies.
