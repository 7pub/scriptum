## A Little Type Theory

### Values and types

Every programming language has values and every value has a type. In type theory lingo this is expressed as types are inhabited by values. Please note that I will use Typescript notation to denote types:

```javascript
undefined // undefined

null // null

true // boolean

123 // number

[1, 2, 3] // number[]

new Set(["abc"]) // Set<string>

{foo: [1, 2, 3]} // {foo: number[]}

const map = f => xs => xs.map(f); // omitting the type for now
const len = xs => xs.length; // omitting the type for now

map(len) (["b", "ba", "bar"]) // <string, number>(f: (x: string) => number) => (xs: string[]) => number[]
```
A type can be inhabited by either no value at all (`undefined`), one value (`null`) or any number of values. Since `undefined` indicates a type error in Javascript, we pretend the corresponding type has no value.

### Value and type constructors

A value constructor takes zero or more values and returns a new value:

```javascript
// built-in value constuctors

null // null

Boolean // <A>(arg: A) => boolean

Array // <A>(...args: A[]) => A[]

Set // <A>(arg: Iterable<A>) => Set<A>

// custom value constructors

const Foo = xs => ({foo: xs});

Foo // <A>(xs: A[]) => {foo: A[]}

class Pair extends Array { // ommitting the type for now
  constructor(x, y) {
    const r = super(2);
    r[0] = x;
    r[1] = y;
    return r;
  }
}

Pair // Pair<A, B>(x: A, y: B) => Pair<A, B>
```
A nullary value constructor like `null` is just a constant.

Type constructors are specified in the type comments of the above example. A type constructor is like a value constructor on the type level. It takes zero or more types and returns a new type. A nullary type constructor like `null` is just a type.

If a value constructor takes more than one value the values it returns inhabit a product type. If a type constructor is associated with more than one value constructor it creates sum types.

In Javascript the only way to create custom types is to declare a new `Object` type, either by using object factories (`Foo`) or by subclassing (`Pair`).

### Higher kinded types

### Parametric polymorphism

### Ad-hoc polymorphism

### Subtype polymorphism

### Row polymorphism

### Structural versus nominal typing

### Type classes

We are almost finished with type theory. If you look at `id`'s type `<A>(x: A) => A` you can see that it has a generic type parameter. As a result `id` must not know anything about the value of the corresponding argument, because it can be any value of any type. This applies to all functions that accept generic type parameters. Any function that takes one or more generic type parameters are parametric polymorphic in these arguments.

Parametric polymorphism is rather uncompromising form of polymorphism. Sometimes a function just needs to know a cetain aspect of a type. With just parametric polymorphism, we would have to fall back to monomorphic types like `number` or `number[]`. Luckily type classes can chime in. Type classes describe a particular aspect of a type. A function that takes a type class accepts any type that implements it, i.e. has an instance of this type class. This form of polymorphism is called ad-hoc polymorphism.
