## Lifting Pure Functions with Functors

A functor is a rather simple thing. The characteristic that renders it so elusive is its generality. Numerous very different data types can implement it.

### Definition

A functor in the context of functional programming is an algebraic structure that has the following traits:

* it is an unary type constructor
* it is associated with a binary operation called map
* map must abide by the functor laws

In the next sections I will explain each of the above terms in a comprehensible way so that you are able to understand the concept sufficiently. I need to give some background information before I can get to the heart of the matter. Please bear with me.

### A little type theory

What is a type in a dynamically typed language? Strictly speaking there is only a single huge union type in Javascript, which comprises all built-in types. Every value can become one of those variants. Simply put the strucutre of a value constitutes a type in Javascript:

```javascript
const foo = {foo: 123}; // an Object type

const bar = new Set([["bar"]]); // a Set type

const bar = x => x; // a Function type
```

* what is an algebraic structure
* what is a type in JS
* what are typeclasses and how can they be implemented in Javasscript
* the mother of all typeclasses (almost)
* hard to understand because they are so general
* container is too narrow an explanation
* lifting into a context fits better
* what is a context: priorized choice, asynchronous, stateful, environment, failure
* two major cointext classes: structure and effect
* a type can comprise several contexts
* functors are composable
* type level vs term level
* parameterized type constructor
* context preserving
* simple API: map
* the name comes from the function mapping a -> b to f a -> f b
* functor laws
