## Loop Fusion and Data Source Abstraction with Transducers

A transducer is nothing more than a pure higher order function that takes a binary function `append`, an accumulator `acc` and an arbitrary value `x` and appends `acc` to `x`. The transducer does not know anything about the data structure its argument `x` is a art of, but it controls the structure of its output. Since appending is a non-associtaive operation there is a left and a right associative operation. Here is the identity transducer to illustrate the essence of the concept, because it does not change its input in any way:

```javascript
append => acc => x => append(acc) (x) // left associative
append => x => acc => append(x) (acc) // right associative
```
A Transducer is intended for being combined with a fold function so that it can be applied to a Foldable data structure. The following chapters will hopefully shed some light on the concept and its use cases.

### Loop fusion

The identity transducer does nothing else than behaving like a transducer. In order to do something useful a transducer must take an additional argument and do something useful with it. Here are the map and filter transducers:

```javascript
const map = f => append => acc => x =>
  append(acc) (f(x));

const filter = p => append => acc => x =>
  p(x)
    ? append(acc) (x)
    : acc;
```
In the following example we apply a composed transducer consisting of `map` and `filter` to take all words with an even length from an array and square their length:

```javascript
const map = f => append => acc => x =>
  append(acc) (f(x));

const filter = p => append => acc => x =>
  p(x)
    ? append(acc) (x)
    : acc;

const transduce = ({append, fold}) => f =>
  fold(f(append));

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const log = x => (console.log(x), x);

const arrFold = f => acc => xs => {
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return log(acc); // test log
};

const arrSnoc_ = xs => x =>
  (xs.push(x), xs);

const getLen = xs => xs.length;

const sqr = x => x * x;

const sqrLen = comp(sqr) (getLen);

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

const xs = ["f", "fo", "foo", "fooo", "foooo", "fooooo"];

main = transduce(
  {append: arrSnoc_, fold: arrFold})
    (comp(map(sqrLen))
      (filter(isEven)))
        ([]);

main(xs); // logs [4, 16, 36] once
```

Although two distinct transducers are involved we only need to traverse the array once. The loops are fused by the composition. But how does this exactly work? When we look at the composition function we see that `f` and `g` are meant to be unary functions. However, the partially applied `map(sqrLen)` and `filter(isEven)` both expect three further arguments:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

append => acc => x => ... // partially applied map

append => acc => x => ... // partially applied filter
```
The trick to understand transducers is to realize that if `x` of `comp` is not a normal value but also function and `f`/`g` of `comp` are not unary functions but n-ary ones, then `x` is passed to `g` as a function argument and hence `g` is a higher order function. When `g` is applied to `x` it itself returns another function that is passed to `f`.

With transducers `x` is `arrSnoc_` and `f` and `g` are the partially applied `map` and `filter`. Hence `append` of `filter` is applied to `arrSnoc_`, the resulting partially applied function is applied to `append` of `map` and thre resulting partially applied function is in turn returned to the caller:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x)); // apply to map(sqrLen)

g => x => map(sqrLen) (g(x)); // apply to filter(isEven)

x => map(sqrLen) (filter(isEven) (x)); // function inlining

x => (append => acc => x => /*body of map*/) ((append => acc => x => /*body of filter*/) (x)); // apply to arrSnoc_

(append => acc => x => /*body of map*/) ((append => acc => x => /*body of filter*/) (arrSnoc_)); // reduce the inner application

(append => acc => x => /*body of map*/) (acc => x => /*body of filter*/); // reduce the application

acc => x => /*body of map*/; // return value
```
Phew! Now when we pass `acc` and `x` to the result function we actually pass them to the partially applied `map`, that is transducers compose from left to right as opposed to ordinary function composition. Another feature of transducers is that we have to pass the append function and the accumulator only once no matter how many transducers are involved.

Maybe you have noticed that in the example above `map` takes the function composition `sqrLen`. Since `map` is itself part of a composition you can think of it as a higher order composition. Compositions that take other compositions as its arguments - this is the spirit of functional programming.

### Abstracting from data sources

Another promise of transducers is there ability to abstract from data sources. A transducer only deals with a single value. It does neither know anything about the structure this value is a part of nor does it know in which order values are pulled out of this structure. As a consequence we can apply our transducers from above to arbitrary data structures, as for instance to a linked list:

```javascript
const List = union("List");

const Nil = List("Nil", {});

const Cons = head => tail =>
  List(Cons, {head, tail});

const cons_ = tail => head =>
  List(Cons, {head, tail});

const listMap = f =>
  rec(xs =>
    match(xs, {
      Nil: _ => Base(Nil),
      Cons: ({head, tail}) => Call(Cons(f(head)), Step(tail))
    }));

const listFold = f => acc => xs =>
  tailRec((acc_, xs) =>
    match(xs, {
      Nil: _ => Base(acc_),
      Cons: ({head, tail}) => Step(f(acc_) (head), tail)
    })) (acc, xs);

const sqr = x => x * x;

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

const main = transduce({append: cons_, fold: listFold})
  (comp(map(sqr))
    (filter(isEven)));

const tx = Cons(1) (Cons(2) (Cons(3) (Cons(4) (Cons(5) (Nil)))));

main(Nil) (tx); // {head: 16, tail: {head: 4, tail: Nil}}
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/DelayedUncomfortableEvaluation)

This transducer composition takes a linked list with numbers, filters all even numbers and squares them. We successfully abstracted from the data source. However, somehow the order of the resulting list is inverted. What has happened? The problem is that we used a left associative fold. You cannot fold a linked list left associatively without inverting its order. In order to prevent that we need a right associative fold operation and since transducers are non-associative we additionally need right associative transducers:

```javascript
const mapr = f => append => x => acc =>
  append(f(x)) (acc);

const filterr = p => append => x => acc =>
  p(x)
    ? append(x) (acc)
    : acc;

const listFoldr = f => acc =>
  rec(xs =>
    match(xs, {
      Nil: _ => Base(acc),
      Cons: ({head, tail}) => Call(f(head), Step(tail))
    }));

const main = transduce({append: Cons, fold: listFoldr})
  (comp(mapr(sqr))
    (filterr(isEven)));

const tx = Cons(1) (Cons(2) (Cons(3) (Cons(4) (Cons(5) (Nil)))));

main(Nil) (tx); // {head: 4, tail: {head: 16, tail: Nil}}
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/PolishedPeruArraylist)

The only difference between a left associative transducer and its right associative counterpart is the order of the latter two arguments and the order in which the `append` function is applied.

### Break out of the Iteration

const map = f => append => acc => x =>
  append(acc) (f(x));

const take = n => append => { 
  let m = 0;

  return acc => x =>

      : acc;
};

const transduce = ({append, fold}) => f =>
  fold(f(append));

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const fix = f => x => f(fix(f)) (x);

const appr = (f, y) => x => f(x) (y);

const _let = f => f();

const log = x => (console.log(x), x);

const arrFold = f => acc => xs => {
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (log(xs[i]), i);

  return acc;
};

const arrSnoc_ = xs => x =>
  (xs.push(x), xs);

const calcBits = n =>
  Math.round(Math.log(n) / Math.log(2));

const xs = [64, 1024, 65536, 16777216, 2147483648];

main = transduce(
  {append: arrSnoc_, fold: arrFold})
    (comp(map(calcBits))
      (take(3)))
        ([]);
