## Data Source Abstraction and Loop Fusion with Transducers

A transducer is nothing more than a pure higher order function that takes a binary function `append`, an accumulator `acc` and an arbitrary value `x` and appends `acc` to `x`. The transducer does not know anything about the data its argument `x` depends on, but it knows the structure of its output. Here is the identity transducer to illustrate the essence of the concept:

```javascript
append => acc => x => append(acc) (x)
append => x => acc => append(x) (acc)
```
Since appending two values is a non-associative operation there is a left and right associative version. This is merely a highly general description though. The following chapters will hopefully shed some light on the concept and its use cases.

### Static loop fusion

The identity transducer does nothing else than behaving like a transducer. In order to do something useful a transducer must take additional arguments. Here are the map and filter transducer:

```javascript
const map = f => append => acc => x =>
  append(acc) (f(x));

const filter = p => append => acc => x =>
  p(x)
    ? append(acc) (x)
    : acc;
```
In the following example we apply a composed transducer consisting of `map` and `filter` to take all words with an even length from an array and square the latter:

```javascript
const map = f => append => acc => x =>
  append(acc) (f(x));

const filter = p => append => acc => x =>
  p(x)
    ? append(acc) (x)
    : acc;

const transduce = ({append, fold}) => f =>
  fold(f(append));

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const log = x => (console.log(x), x);

const arrFold = f => acc => xs => {
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return log(acc); // test log
};

const arrSnoc_ = xs => x =>
  (xs.push(x), xs);

const getLen = xs => xs.length;

const sqr = x => x * x;

const sqrLen = comp(sqr) (getLen);

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

const xs = ["f", "fo", "foo", "fooo", "foooo", "fooooo"];

main = transduce(
  {append: arrSnoc_, fold: arrFold})
    (comp(map(sqrLen))
      (filter(isEven)))
        ([]);

main(xs); // logs [4, 16, 36] once
```

Although two distinct transducers are involved we only need to traverse the array once. Composed transducers allow loop fusion. And since `map` expects a normal pure function as its first argument it can be a composed function as well.

### Dynamic loop fusion

### Abstracting from data sources

### Break out of the Iteration

### Transduce infinite data structures
