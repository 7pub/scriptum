## Loop Fusion and Data Source Abstraction with Transducers

A transducer is just a pure higher order function that takes a binary function `append`, an accumulator `acc` and an arbitrary value `x` and appends `acc` to `x`. It does neither know anything about the data structure of its input `x` nor about the structure of its output. Since appending is a non-associative operation there is a left and a right associative one. Here is the identity transducer to illustrate the essence of the concept:

```javascript
append => acc => x => append(acc) (x) // left associative
append => x => acc => append(x) (acc) // right associative
```
Transducers are intended for being feeded to the corresponding fold function of a `Foldable` data type so that they can be applied to each element of this structure. The following chapters will hopefully shed some light on the concept and its use cases.

### Loop fusion

The identity transducer is doing nothing but being a transducer. It does not change its input in any way. In order to do something useful a transducer must take an additional argument and use it in a meaningful way. Here are the `map` and `filter` transducers:

```javascript
const map = f => append => acc => x =>
  append(acc) (f(x));

const filter = p => append => acc => x =>
  p(x)
    ? append(acc) (x)
    : acc;
```
In the following example we apply a composed transducer consisting of `map` and `filter` to take all words with an even length from an array and square their length:

```javascript
const map = f => append => acc => x =>
  append(acc) (f(x));

const filter = p => append => acc => x =>
  p(x)
    ? append(acc) (x)
    : acc;

const transduce = ({append, fold}) => f =>
  fold(f(append));

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const log = x => (console.log(x), x);

const arrFold = f => acc => xs => {
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return log(acc); // test log
};

const arrSnoc_ = xs => x =>
  (xs.push(x), xs);

const getLen = xs => xs.length;

const sqr = x => x * x;

const sqrLen = comp(sqr) (getLen);

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

const xs = ["f", "fo", "foo", "fooo", "foooo", "fooooo"];

main = transduce(
  {append: arrSnoc_, fold: arrFold})
    (comp(map(sqrLen))
      (filter(isEven)))
        ([]);

main(xs); // logs [4, 16, 36] once
```

Although two distinct transducers are involved we only need to traverse the array once. Instead of passing the array's elements to one transducer after another they are passed to the transducer composition, which acts like a single transducer. The composition fuses the loops so to speak. But how does this exactly work? When we look at `comp` we see that `f` and `g` are meant to be unary functions. However, the partially applied `map(sqrLen)` and `filter(isEven)` both expect three further arguments. How does this fit together?

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x)); // apply partially applied map

g => x => map(sqrLen) (g(x)); // apply partially applied filter

x => map(sqrLen) (filter(isEven) (x)); // function inlining
  
x => (f => append => acc => x => /* map body */) (sqrLen)
  ((p => append => acc => x => /* filter body */) (isEven) (x));
  
// apply arrSnoc_
  
(f => append => acc => x => /* map body */) (sqrLen)
  ((p => append => acc => x => /* filter body */) (isEven) (arrSnoc_));
    
// reduce applications until normal form
  
(append => acc => x => /* map body */)
  ((append => acc => x => /* filter body */) (arrSnoc_));
  
(append => acc => x => /* map body */)
  ((acc => x => /* filter body */));

(acc => x => /* map body */); // result value
```
The following observations can be made:

* `x` of `comp` is not an arbitrary value but another function, namely `arrSnoc_`
* filter's `append` is initialized with `arrSnoc_`
* map's `append` is initialized with the partially applied `filter(isEven) (arrSnoc_)`
* the partially applied `map(sqrLen) (filter(isEven) (arrSnoc_))` is returned to the caller

Next `fold` applies this result value to the given accumulator `[]` and iteratively to each element contained in the array. Since `map` is wired with `filter` through the `append` function, the latter is also called in every iteration after the `map` transformation, namely with `map`'s result value. We can conclude from this process description that transducer compose from left to right, which they indeed do.

Maybe you have noticed that in the given example `map` takes a function composition as its first argument, while it itself is part of a composition. A composition that take another composition as its argument - this sounds like higher order compostion and perfectly represents the spirit of functional programming.

### Abstracting from data sources

Another trait of transducers is their ability to abstract from their data source. A transducer only deals with a single value at a time. It does neither know anything about the underlying structure nor in what order values are pulled out of it. As a consequence we can apply every transducer to every data structure that is at least `Foldable`, i.e. which has an associated fold function:

```javascript
// LIST

const List = union("List");

const Nil = List("Nil", {});

const Cons = head => tail =>
  List(Cons, {head, tail});

const cons_ = tail => head =>
  List(Cons, {head, tail});

// Foldable

const listFold = f => acc => xs =>
  tailRec((acc_, xs) =>
    match(xs, {
      Nil: _ => Base(acc_),
      Cons: ({head, tail}) => Step(f(acc_) (head), tail)
    })) (acc, xs);

// auxiliary functions

const sqr = x => x * x;

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

// MAIN

const main = transduce({append: cons_, fold: listFold})
  (comp(map(sqr))
    (filter(isEven)));

const tx = Cons(1) (Cons(2) (Cons(3) (Cons(4) (Cons(5) (Nil)))));

main(Nil) (tx); // {head: 16, tail: {head: 4, tail: Nil}}
```

This time our `map` and `filter` transducer composition takes a linked list of numbers, filters all even numbers and squares them. We succeeded in abstracting from the data source.

However, the order of the resulting list is inverted. Do you recall that appending is a non-associative operation? The inverted list witnesses this fact. A left-associative fold of a linked list always inverts their order. The only way to prevent this consists in using a right fold along with right associative transducers:

```javascript
// transducer

const mapr = f => append => x => acc =>
  append(f(x)) (acc);

const filterr = p => append => x => acc =>
  p(x)
    ? append(x) (acc)
    : acc;

// Foldable

const listFoldr = f => acc =>
  rec(xs =>
    match(xs, {
      Nil: _ => Base(acc),
      Cons: ({head, tail}) => Call(f(head), Step(tail))
    }));

// MAIN

const main = transduce({append: Cons, fold: listFoldr})
  (comp(mapr(sqr))
    (filterr(isEven)));

const tx = Cons(1) (Cons(2) (Cons(3) (Cons(4) (Cons(5) (Nil)))));

main(Nil) (tx); // {head: 4, tail: {head: 16, tail: Nil}}
```

### Break out of the iteration

There are to ways to prematurely break out of a fold:

* use a lazy right associative one
* utilize local continuation passing style

In this chapter we will take a closer look at the latter approach. CPS requires all involved functions to have a continuation defined as their last formal parameter. Local means in this context that the continuation requirement is limited among the directly involved functions and does not infect any other functions.

With transducers the specific instances of `fold`, `append` and the composed transducers themselves need to be defined in CPS:

```javascript
// transducer

const mapk = f => append => acc => x =>
  Cont(k =>
    append(acc) (f(x)).cont(k));

const takek = n => append => { 
  let m = 0;

  return acc => x =>
    Cont(k =>
      m < n
        ? (m++, append(acc) (x).cont(k))
        : Base(acc))};

// record constructor

const record = (type, o) =>
  (o[type.name || type] = type.name || type, o);

// Cont

const Cont = cont =>
  record("Cont", {cont});

// Foldable

const arrFoldk = f => acc => xs =>
  tailRec((acc_, i) =>
    i === xs.length
      ? Base(acc_)
      : f(acc_) (log(xs[i]), i).cont(acc__ => Step(acc__, i + 1))) (acc, 0);

// auxiliary function

const calcBits = n =>
  Math.round(Math.log(n) / Math.log(2));

// MAIN

const xs = [32, 64, 4096, 65536, 16777216, 2147483648];

const main = transduce(
  {append: arrSnoc_, fold: arrFoldk})
    (comp(mapk(calcBits))
      (takek(3)))
        ([]);

main(xs); // logs 32, 64, 4096 and 65536 and yields [5, 6, 12]
```

As you can see the algorithm prematurely breaks out of the iteration as soon as the required number of array elements are processed. We will learn more about how to transform function into continuation passing style and how we can benefit from CPS in a subsequent chapter of this course.
