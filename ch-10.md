## Trading the Stack for the Heap with Trampolines

Some multi paradigm languages like Javascript are lacking optimization strategies to allow different forms of stack safe recursion. This chapter examines the most important optimizations and demonstrates how stack safe recursion can be achieved through the trampoline technique.

### Compiler optimization strategies

If the recursive step of an algorithm is in tail position compilers can conduct tail call optimization, i.e. they can share a single stack frame throughout the whole recursive computation and eliminate additional frames. This is not only much more efficient but also avoids exhausting the function call stack for large recursive computations:

```javascript
const foldl = f => acc => ([h, t]) =>
  h === undefined
    ? acc
    : foldl(f) (f(acc) (h)) (t);
//    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ tail call can share its stack frame with subsequent tail calls
```

Tail call optimization can be further generalized to tail recursion modulo cons (short for constructor). While TCO only kicks in when the recursive step is in tail position TRMC allows the recursive step to be within a value constrcutor, as long as this constrcutor performs an associative operation:

```javascript
const foldr = f => acc => ([h, t]) =>
  h === undefined
    ? acc
    : f(h) (foldr(f) (acc) (t));
//          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ recursive step can share its stack frame with subsequent steps provided f is associative
```
Please note that in lazily evaluated languages like Haskell TRMC is called guarded recursion and is not an optimization technique but a side effect of lazy evaluation.

### Deferred function call trees

For some recursive functions it is not sufficient to make the algorithm itself stack safe, because the resulting data structure is also stack critical:

```javascript
const compn = fs =>
  fs.reduce((f, g) => comp(f) (g), x => x);

const compn_ = fs => x =>
  fs.reduce((x, f) => f(x), x);

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const inc = x => x + 1;

const fs = Array(1e5).fill(inc);

const main = compn(fs), // stack safe
  main_ = compn_(fs); // stack-safe
  
main(0); // stack overflow
main_(0); // 100000
```

`compn` creates a deferred nested function call tree, which may exhaust the function call stack once it is passed the missing argument. In order to make it stack safe we have to deal with both the recursive algorithm and the recursive data structure it creates.

### A tail recursive trampoline

Trampolines offer a functional interface to write pseudo-recursive algorithms, while under the hood an imperative loop does all the work. Here is a possible implementation to mimic tail recursive algorithms:

```javascript
const tailRec = f => (...args) => {
    let step = f(...args);

    while (step.tag !== Base)
      step = f(...step.args);

    return step.x;
};

const Base = x =>
  ({tag: Base, x});

const Step = (...args) =>
  ({tag: Step, args});

const fold = f => acc => xs =>
  tailRec((acc_, i) =>
    i === xs.length
      ? Base(acc_)
      : Step(f(acc_) (xs[i]), i + 1))
          (acc, 0);

const sub = x => y => x - y;

const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1);

fold(sub) (0) (xs); // -100000
```

A stack safe Fibonacci sequence:

```javascript
const fib = n =>
  tailRec((x, y, m) =>
    m > 1
      ? Step(y, x + y, m - 1)
      : Base(x))
          (1, 1, n);
          
fib(10); // 55
```

#### A tail recursive modulo cons trampoline

We do not have to stop at this point. We can extend `tailRec` with its own stack structure to get a TRMC like effect:

```javascript
const rec = f => (...args) => {
  let step = f(...args);
  const stack = [];

  while (step.tag !== Base) {
    stack.push(step.f);
    step = f(...step.step.args);
  }

  let r = step.x;

  for (let i = stack.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    r = stack[i] (r);
    
    if (r && r.tag === Base) {
      r = r.x;
      break;
    }
  }

  return r;
};

const Base = x =>
  ({tag: Base, x});

const Call = (f, step) =>
  ({tag: Call, f, step});

const Step = (...args) =>
  ({tag: Step, args});
```
Now we are able to implement a right associative fold:

```javascript
const foldr = f => acc => xs =>
  rec(i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? Base(acc)
      : Call(f(xs[i]), Step(i + 1))) (0);
      
const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1);

foldr(sub) (0) (xs); // 0 (instead of -100000 for the left associative fold)
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/NavyblueLoneConditions)

Can we also express the Fibonacci sequence using `rec`? No, because the recursive step is in both arguments of the function:

```javascript
const fibBody = n =>
  n > 1
    ? add(fib(n - 1)) (fib(n - 2))
//        ^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^ recursive steps in both arguments
    : n;
```
TRMC only works if the value of the first argument is known when the recursive step in the second is performed. In order to make `fib` stack safe we have to manually transform it into a tail recursive accumulator-style algorithm.

Please note that the `rec` trampoline goes beyond TRMC by allowing the value constructor to be non-associative as with substraction.

#### An indirect recursive trampoline

Instead of `fib` I use the classic `even`/`odd` example, because it can be expressed more naturally by an indirect recursive definition and is easer to comprehend:

```javascript
const monadRec = step => {
    while (step.tag !== Base)
      step = step.f(...step.args);

    return step.x;
};

const Base = x =>
  ({tag: Base, x});

const Chain = f => (...args) =>
  ({tag: Chain, f, args});

const recChain = mx => fm =>
  mx.tag === Chain
    ? Chain(args => recChain(mx.f(...args)) (fm)) (mx.args)
    : fm(mx.x);

const recOf = Base;

const even = Chain(n =>
  n === 0
    ? recOf(true)
    : recChain(recOf(n - 1)) (m => odd(m)));

const odd = Chain(n =>
  n === 0
    ? recOf(false)
    : recChain(recOf(n - 1)) (m => even(m)));

monadRec(even(10000)); // true

monadRec(odd(10000)); // false
```

Please note that the name is no coincidence. `monadRec` is actually one part of the `Trampoline` monad and besides mutual recursion used for monadic recursion. We will learn more about monads in a subsequent chapter of this course.
