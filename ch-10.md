## Data Structure Abstraction and Loop Fusion with Transducers

A transducer is nothing else than a pure higher order function that takes a binary function, an accumulator and an arbitrary value and append the accumulator with this value. It does not know anything about the structure its input depends on but it knows the structure of its output. Here is the identity transducer to illustrate the essence of the concept:

```javascript
append => acc => x => append(acc) (x)
append => x => acc => append(x) (acc)
```
Since appending two values is a non associative operation there is a left and right associative version. This is merely a highly general description. The following chapters will hopefully shed some light on the concept and its use cases.

### Static loop fusion

### Dynamic loop fusion

### Abstracting from data structures

### Associativity

### Break out of transducers

### Transduce infinite data structures
