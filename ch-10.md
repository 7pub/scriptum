## Data Source Abstraction and Loop Fusion with Transducers

A transducer is nothing more than a pure higher order function that takes a binary function `append`, an accumulator `acc` and an arbitrary value `x` and appends `acc` to `x`. The transducer does not know anything about the data its argument `x` depends on, but it knows the structure of its output. Here is the identity transducer to illustrate the essence of the concept:

```javascript
append => acc => x => append(acc) (x)
append => x => acc => append(x) (acc)
```
Since appending two values is a non-associative operation there is a left and right associative version. This is merely a highly general description though. The following chapters will hopefully shed some light on the concept and its use cases.

### Static loop fusion

### Dynamic loop fusion

### Abstracting from data sources

### Break out of the Iteration

### Transduce infinite data structures
