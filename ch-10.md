## Trading the Stack for the Heap with Trampolines

### Compiler/Interpreter optimization strategies

If the recursive step of an algorithm is in tail position compilers/interpreters can conduct tail call optimization, i.e. they can share a single stack frame throughout the whole recursive computation by eliminating additional frames. This is not only much more efficient but also avoids exhausting the function call stack. Even though Ecmascript 2015 defines TCO it is not implemented yet in any major browser:

```javascript
const foldl = f => acc => ([h, t]) =>
  h === undefined
    ? acc
    : foldl(f) (f(acc) (h)) (t);
//    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ performs TCO
```

Tail call optimization can be further generalized to tail recursion modulo cons (short for constructor). Where TCO only kicks in when the recursive step is in tail position TRMC allows the recursive step to be passed as the second argument of a binary function, as long as this function performs an associative operation:

```javascript
const foldr = f => acc => ([h, t]) =>
  h === undefined
    ? acc
    : f(h) (foldr(f) (acc) (t));
//          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ performs TRMC provided f is associative
```
Please note that in lazily evaluated languages like Haskell this optimization technique is called guarded recursion. Javascript does not support TRMC either.

### From trampolines to full-grown evaluators

Trampolines offer a functional interface to write pseudo-recursive algorithms, while under the hood an imperative loop does all the work. Usually trampolines merely cover tail recursive algorithms. However, we can extend the concept to full-grown evaluators that are equally powerful as tail recursion modulo cons.

An ordinary trampoline for tail recursion:

```javascript
const tailRec = f => (...args) => {
    let step = f(...args);

    while (step.tag !== Base)
      step = f(...step.args);

    return step.x;
};
```
An extended trampoline for limited body recursion:

```javascript
const rec = f => (...args) => {
  let step = f(...args);
  const stack = [];

  while (step.tag !== Base) {
    stack.push(step.f);
    step = f(...step.step.args);
  }

  let r = step.x;

  for (let i = stack.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    r = stack[i] (r);
    
    if (r && r.tag === Base) {
      r = r.x;
      break;
    }
  }

  return r;
};
```
The necessary tags to build pseudo-recursive algorithms:

```javascript
const Base = x =>
  ({tag: Base, x});


const Call = (f, step) =>
  ({tag: Call, f, step});


const Step = (...args) =>
  ({tag: Step, args});
```
#### Mimicking tail recursion

Let us encode a tail recursive list fold using a trampoline:

```javascript
fold = f => acc => xs => {
  const go = (acc_, i) =>
    i === xs.length
      ? acc
      : go(f(acc_) (xs[i]) (i + 1);

  return go([], 0);
};

fold_ = f => acc => xs =>
  tailRec((acc_, i) =>
    i === xs.length
      ? Base(acc_)
      : Step(f(acc_) (xs[i]), i + 1))
          (acc, 0);
```

The same procedure for the Fibnacci sequence:

```javascript
const fibTail = n => {
  const go = (x, y, m) =>
    m > 1
      ? go(y, x + y, m - 1) // recursive step
      : y; // base case

  return go(0, 1, n);
};

fibTail_ = n =>
  tailRec((x, y, m) =>
    m > 1
      ? Step(y, x + y, m - 1)
      : Base(x))
          (1, 1, n);
```

#### Mimicking tail recursion modulo cons

Next comes the transformation of a right associative fold implemented as a body recursive algorithm:

```javascript
foldr = f => acc => xs => {
  const go = i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? acc
      : f(xs[i]) (go(i + 1));

  return go(0);
};

const foldr_ = f => acc => xs =>
  rec(i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? Base(acc)
      : Call(f(xs[i]), Step(i + 1))) (0);
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/SpecificBasicDebugger)

The same procedure for Fibonacci fails, because the underlying algorithm has two recursive steps for each operand of the addition:

```javascript
const fibBody = n =>
  n > 1
    ? fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) // recursive step
    : n; // base case
```
We cannot express this form of recursion using our `rec` trampoline. Like with TRMC we can only optimize if the recursive call is only in the second argument of the operation. But going beyond TRMC we can also optimize non-associative operations like subtraction or division.

#### Trampolines with short circuit semantics

It is easy to break out of imperative loops prematurely and likewise it is with recursion. A proper trampoline implementation must offer such a feature as well:

```javascript
const snoc = x => xs => (xs.push(x), xs);

const take = n => xs =>
  tailRec((acc, i) =>
    i === n
      ? Base(acc)
      : Step(snoc(xs[i]) (acc), i + 1))
          ([], 0);

take(3) ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // [1, 2, 3]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/repls/CornyPiercingLivedistro)

With `rec` we can also break out of a right associative recursive operation. Please note that the following implementation is very inefficient and just serves for illustration:

```javascript
const cons = x => xs => (xs.unshift(x), xs);
const id = x => x;

const takeLast = n => xs =>
  rec(i =>
    xs.length === i ? Base([])
      : xs.length - i <= n ? Call(cons(xs[i]), Step(i + 1))
      : Call(id, Step(i + 1)))
          (0);

takeLast(3) ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // [3, 4, 5]
```

#### Mimicking indirect recursion

TODO: description

Instead of `fib` I use the classic `even`/`odd` example, because the implementation is more natural and easer to follow:

```javascript
const monadRec = step => {
    while (step.tag !== Base)
      step = step.f(...step.args);

    return step.x;
};

const Base = x =>
  ({tag: Base, x});

const Chain = f => (...args) =>
  ({tag: Chain, f, args});

const recChain = mx => fm =>
  mx.tag === Chain
    ? Chain(args => recChain(mx.f(...args)) (fm)) (mx.args)
    : fm(mx.x);

const recOf = Base;

const even = Chain(n =>
  n === 0
    ? recOf(true)
    : recChain(recOf(n - 1)) (m => odd(m)));

const odd = Chain(n =>
  n === 0
    ? recOf(false)
    : recChain(recOf(n - 1)) (m => even(m)));

monadRec(even(10000)); // true

monadRec(odd(10000)); // false
```
