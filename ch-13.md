## Lifting Pure Functions with Functors

A functor is a rather simple thing. The characteristic that renders it so elusive is its generality. Numerous very different data types can implement it.

### Definition

A functor in the context of functional programming is an algebraic structure that has the following traits:

* it is an unary higher-order type constructor
* it is associated with a binary operation called map
* map must abide by the functor laws

This listing is not particularly helpful to understand functors. Please bear with me. We will come to it.

### Algebraic structures

A functor is an algebraic structure, i.e. it comes from math. An algebraic structure consists of

* a set of entities
* one or more operations
* one or more axioms

Translated to the programming context this means an algebraic structure

* is implemented as a type class
* has one or more functions or values
* these functions must abide by one or more laws

### Term level

The term level is where the actual programming with value constrcutors, functions and values takes place. It is complemented by the type level where type constructors (paramterized types) and proper types exist.

So what constitutes a functor on the term level?

#### Map operation

Every functor has an associated `map` operation, wich is a binary function:

```javascript
const map = f => tx => ???
```

But what does it exactly do? At the beginning of this chapter I mentioned that functors are so hard to grasp because they are so general. Consequently `map`'s operation is hard to describe in natural language. I will give it a shot in the following two sections.

#### Lift pure functions into a context

A functor lifts an ordinary pure function into a context. Let us pretend within this section that a context is a container-like data structure, an `Array` for example. So a functor lifts an ordinary pure function into an container-like data structure:

```javascript
// binary map operation
const map = f => xs =>
  xs.map(x => f(x));
  
// a pure function
const inc = n => n + 1;
  
map(inc) ([1, 2, 3]); // [2, 3, 4]
```
By supplying an overloaded `map` operation, we can reuse pure functions for all container-like data structures. This is an enormous win in terms of code reuse.

However, this is merely a very simplified description of a functor. The functors concept does not stop at containers. It begins with them.

#### What is a context?

This is the part of functors that renders them so generalized. A context can be almost everything, for example

* a priorized choice
* a computation that may fail
* a computation with a shared read-only environment
* a computation with a shared write-only environment
* a stateful computation
* an asynchronous computation
* a lazy evaluated computation
* a computation that refies the rest of the program

And this enumeration is only the tip of the iceberg. We can reuse ordinary pure functions in all these contexts and many more. The degree of code reuse is tremendous. Additionally, for all these contexts the mechanism, that is, the way functors work is exactly the same. Imagine how much code predictability we gain. We well examine each of the listed contexts and their corresponding data types in later chapters of this course.

#### Context preserving

### Functor laws

So that is it, functors on the term level. If you work with an untyped language you are ready now.

### Type level

### Forms a type class

### Functors are composable




* what is an algebraic structure
* container is too narrow an explanation
* lifting into a context fits better
* what is a context: priorized choice, asynchronous, stateful, environment, failure
* two major cointext classes: structure and effect
* a type can comprise several contexts
* functors are composable
* type level vs term level
* parameterized type constructor
* context preserving
* simple API: map
* the name comes from the function mapping a -> b to f a -> f b
* functor laws
