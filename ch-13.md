## Type class polymorphism through dictionary passing style

Although we can mimic type classes with Javascript's prototype system this mechanism binds types to prototypes and thus to the data itself. This trait somewhat limits the expressiveness of prototype based type classes. Additionally Typescript does not support higher-order type constructors (also known as higher-kinded types) and therefore cannot natively type most common type classes. For these reasons I decided to drop prototypes and rely on dictionary passing style instead. DPS is more verbose but as expressive as type classes and makes these constraints explicit.

With DPS we pass type dictionaries as arguments to ad-hoc polymorphic functions. A type dictionary is just a plain old Javascript `Object` which contains the overloaded operations the function requires. It is always defined as the first formal parameter:

```javascript
foo({typeClassOp1, typeClassOp2}) (arg);
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ type dictionary
//                                 ^^^ regular arguments
```
`foo` expects a type dictionary with two type class operations as properties. Since we use a POJO the order does not matter. If a function only needs a single type class operation we can omit the object and pass the plain operation:

```javascript
foo(typeClassOp) (arg);
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^ single type class operation
//                ^^^ regular arguments
```
Type classes consist of overloaded operations and laws. How do we manage them when Javascript does not support overloaded names? Well, we keep things simple and just use a name prefix in order to avoid name clashes:

```javascript
const arrTypeClassOp = arg1 => arg2 => /* Array instance */;
//    ^^^ type prefix
const arrTypeClassOp = arg1 => arg2 => /* Option instance */;
//    ^^^ type prefix
```
This is a straightforward approach. We can declare functions as usual and combine them to type dictionaries in place, as soon as ad-hoc polymorphic functions require them. Let me demonstrate dictionary passing style using the `foldMap` polymorphic function:

```javascript
// ad-hoc polymorphic function

const foldMap = ({fold, append, empty}) => f =>
  fold(comp2nd(append) (f)) (empty());

// array instances

const arrFold = f => acc => xs => {
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

// number instances

const add = x => y => x + y;

const addEmpty = () => 0;

// auxiliary functions

const comp2nd = f => g => x => y =>
  f(x) (g(y));
  
const sqr = x => x * x;
  
// MAIN

const xs = [1, 2, 3];

const arrFoldMap = foldMap({fold: arrFold, append: add, empty: addEmpty});
//                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ type dictionary

arrFoldMap(sqr) (xs); // 14
```

We can reuse `foldMap` with each type that implements these three operations. `fold` is part of the `Foldable` and `append`/`empty` of the `Monoid` type class. We will discuss all these type classes in later chapters of this course. Moreover, in the second part of this course we will see how easy it is to type ad-hoc polymorphic functions encoded in DPS with Typescript.
