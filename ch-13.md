## Lifting Pure Functions with Functors

A functor is a rather simple thing. The characteristic that renders it so elusive is its generality. Numerous very different data types can implement it.

### Definition

A functor in the context of functional programming is an algebraic structure that has the following traits:

* it is an unary higher-order type constructor
* it is associated with a binary operation called map
* map must abide by the functor laws

This listing is not particularly helpful to understand functors. Please bear with me. We will come to it.

### Algebraic structures

A functor is an algebraic structure, i.e. it comes from math. An algebraic structure consists of

* a set of entities
* one or more operations
* one or more axioms

Translated to the programming context this means an algebraic structure

* is implemented as a type class
* has one or more associated functions or values under unique names
* has one or more laws associated functions must abide by

### Term level

At the term level the actual programming with value constructors, functions and values takes place. It is complemented by the type level where type constructors (paramterized types) and proper types exist.

First we will explore what constitutes a functor on the term level.

#### Map operation

Every functor has an associated `map` operation, wich is a binary function:

```javascript
const map = f => tx => ???
```

But what does it exactly do? At the beginning of this chapter I mentioned that functors are so hard to grasp because they are so general. Consequently `map`'s operation is hard to describe in natural language. I will give it a shot in the following two sections.

#### Lift pure functions into a context

A functor lifts an ordinary pure function into a context. Let us pretend within this section that a context is a container-like data structure, an `Array` for example. So a functor lifts an ordinary pure function into an container-like data structure:

```javascript
// binary map operation
const map = f => xs =>
  xs.map(x => f(x));
  
// a pure function
const inc = n => n + 1;
  
map(inc) ([1, 2, 3]); // [2, 3, 4]
```
By supplying an overloaded `map` operation, we can reuse pure functions for all container-like data structures. This is an enormous win in terms of code reuse.

However, this is merely a very simplified description of a functor. The functors concept does not stop at containers. It begins with them.

#### What is a context?

This is the part of functors that renders them so generalized. A context can be almost everything, for example

* a priorized choice
* a computation that may fail
* a computation with a shared read-only environment
* a computation with a shared write-only environment
* a stateful computation
* an asynchronous computation
* a lazy evaluated computation
* a computation that refies the rest of the program

And this enumeration is only the tip of the iceberg. We can reuse ordinary pure functions in all these contexts and many more. The degree of code reuse is tremendous. Additionally, for all these contexts the mechanism, that is, the way functors work is exactly the same. Imagine how much code predictability we gain. We well examine each of the listed contexts and their corresponding data types in later chapters of this course.

#### Functor laws

I am going to use the array type to illustrate the functor laws. The first functor law defines:

```javascript
const map = f => xs =>
  xs.map(x => f(x));
  
const id = x => x;

map(id) ([1, 2, 3]).toString() ===
  id([1, 2, 3]).toString(); // true
```
This determines that a functor must only transform values and leave the context untouched.

The second functor law defines:

```javascript
const map = f => xs =>
  xs.map(x => f(x));

const id = x => x;

const comp = f => g => x =>
  f(g(x));

map(comp(id) (id)) ([1, 2, 3]).toString() ===
  comp(map(id)) (map(id)) ([1, 2, 3]).toString()
```
This determines that the `map` operation is associative.

#### Context preserving

We can derive from the first functor law that functors have to be context preserving. A functor must transform the values in a context but must not touch the context itself:

```javascript
[1, 2, 3] -- context preserving transformation --> [1, 4, 9]
[1, 2, 3] -- context preserving transformation --> [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]

[1, 2, 3] -- invlaid transformation --> [1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3] -- invalid transformation --> [3, 2, 1]
```
### Type level

A fucntor is a higher-order type constrcutor parameterized with a single type:

```typescript
type Array<A>; // first order type constructor (array type)
type F<A>; // higher order type constructor (functor type)
```
`F<A>` represents the functor on the type level. `F` is the context and `A` are the values or a single value. As we have just learned in the term level section of this chapter a functor can be defined for various contexts, not only for arrays.

### Context once again

We have only enumerated possible contexts so far. A precise definition without resorting to metaphors is still lacking. As programmers it is obvious to try to define something abstract using functions. For each context there are one or more associated functions that only operate on the context and do not touch the contained values. These functions define what exaclty this context is. Let us illustrate this thought using array functions:

```javascript
const len = xs => xs.length;

const head = def => xs =>
  xs.length === 0
    ? def
    : xs[0];
    
const reverse = xs => xs.reverse();
```
All given functions do not touch the array elements at all but only operate on its structure, hence they accurately define this context. From a type level perspective the above functions are fully polymorphic on the type parameter `A` of the functor `F<A>`.

Now that we know what a context is it is noteworthy that a type can have more than one context and thus more than one associated functor.
