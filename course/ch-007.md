## Linear Data Flow and Flat Composition Syntax

**[Editor's note: this chapter needs edit]**

There are two ways to obtain method chaining in Javascript, either by relying on the [prototype system](https://repl.it/@scriptum/CheapTurquoiseUnit) or by using plain old Javascript [object factories](https://repl.it/@scriptum/RegalTriflingFactor). While the former is language specific and encodes the idea of object oriented programming, object factories are quite inefficient as soon as continuously to be created objects include a larger numbers of methods. In this chapter we will therefore stick with function composition and explore techniques to reduce nesting.

### Prefix notation and S-expressions

Functions in Javascript are written in prefix notation, i.e. the name comes first and is followed by the argument list. Prefix notation leads to nested functions calls, which resemble Lisp style S-expressions:

```Javascript
const sub = x => y => x - y;

sub(
  sub(
    sub(
      sub(1) (2)) (3)) (4)) (5); // -13
```
We can avoid nested syntax using native operators, which are written in infix position:

```Javascript
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5; // -13
```
The evaluation order of expressions with infix operators is determined by their precedence and associativity. Subtraction, for instance, has a higher precedence than multiplication

```Javascript
1 + 2 * 3;   // 7 (predefined precedence)
(1 + 2) * 3; // 9 (enforced precedence)
```
and is left-associative

```Javascript
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5;         // -13 (left-associative by default)
(1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - 5)))); // 3 (right-associative by parentheses)
```
Unfortunately, we cannot define custom infix operators in Javascript but have to resort to operator functions, which are again in prefix position. So are we condemned to build nested S-expressions?

### Alleviate nesting with function composition

A bunch of arity aware function composition functions allow us to reduce the syntactic noise:

```javascript
const comp ...
const comp3 ...

const comp4 = f => g => h => i => x =>
  f(g(h(i(x))));

const comp5 ...
const comp6 ...

const sub = x => y => x - y;

comp4(
  sub(1))
  (sub(2))
  (sub(3))
  (sub(4))
  (5); // (1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - 5)))) = 3
```

Since function application is not associative we need another operator function with its arguments flipped and an inverted `comp` function:

```javascript
const pipe4 = i => h => g => f => x =>
  f(g(h(i(x))));

const sub_ = y => x => x - y;

pipe4(
  sub_(2))
  (sub_(3))
  (sub_(4))
  (sub_(5))
  (1); // ((((1 - 2) - 3) - 4) - 5) = -13
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/CapitalSociableUser)

When we compose binary functions we need to partially apply them and pass the missing argument to the resulting composition. The missing argument is the rightmost one of the computation, consequently function composition is inherently right-associative. It computes the rightmost operands and applies the result to its predecessor.

When we want to retrieve a left-associative computation we need to reverse the operand order and apply an operator with flipped arguments. If you want to get away with the normal operand order you can utilize the reverse function composition operator `pipe` alternatively. Keep in mind though that with reverse composition you need to pass the leftmost operand, because left-accosiative computation starts from the left and makes its way to the right.

Please note that I denote functions with flipped arguments with a trailing underscore in their name to spare the noise of the `flip` combinator.

### Why relying on arity-aware combinators in the first place?

We could easily build a variadic compostion function that fits all cases:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const id = x => x;

const sub = x => y => x - y;
const sub_ = y => x => x - y;
const repeat = s => n => s.repeat(n);

const compn = fs =>
  fs.reduce((f, g) => comp(f) (g), id);

const fs = [repeat("x"), sub(1), sub(2), sub(3), sub(4)]; // "xxx"

compn(fs) (5);
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/HurtfulSandybrownWorkspace)

But what type would `fs` have? If we typed it as an array `A[]`, all functions would have to share the same type, `(_: number) => number` for instance. If we typed it as a tuple `[A, B]` we would have to define all possible tuple sizes. Knowing this simple arity aware composition functions seem to be the lesser of two evils.

### Infix combinators

There are two more combinator that come in handy to improve readability:

```javascript
const infix = (x, f, y) => f(x) (y);
const appr = (f, y) => x => f(x) (y);

const sub3 = appr(sub, 3);

infix(2, sub, 3); // -1
sub3(2); // -1
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/VirtualLuxuriousStacks)

`infix` mimics the notation of the same name, which is usually reserved to built-in operators in Javascript. `appr` is similar to the `flip` combinator but takes advantage of Javascript's multi-argument feature.

### Prospect of other forms of flat compositions

Keeping the syntax of ordinary function composition flat is not even half of the deal. There are plenty of types of compositions to discover and we will introduce suitable combinators which enable a linear data flow within the respective chapters.
