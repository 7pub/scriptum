## A Little Type Theory

Even though the first part of this course is kept untyped, we need type theory knowledge to understand the chapters to come. Please note that I will use Typescript notation to annotate types.

### Structural versus nominal type system

Two major type systems can be distinguished. A structural type system determines type equality and compatibility by the type's actual structure. A type `B` is considered a subtype of another type `A` if `B` contains extra properties in addition to `A`'s ones:

```javascript
type foo = {x: number};
type bar = {x: number};
type baz = {x: number, y: string};

const foo: foo = {x: 2};
const bar: bar = {x: 3};
const baz: baz = {x: 4 , y: "abc"};

const addObj = (o: foo) => (p: foo) =>
  foo.x + foo.x;

// foo and bar are equal types
addObj(foo) (bar);

// foo and baz are compatible types because baz is a subtype of foo
addObj(foo) (baz);
```
A nominal type system on the other hand determines type equality and compatibility based on names. In such a type system only the application `addObj(foo) (foo)` would type check.

Typescript is nominally typed for classes and otherwise structurally typed.

### Polymorphism in the general sense

The motivation for polymorphism in type systems comes from the idea of generalization: We always strive to apply a concept to a wider range of scenarios. In terms of a type system this means to be able to annotate different data structures and algorithms with the same type. In this chapter we will first cover some ground work and afterwards take a closer look at various forms of polymorphism.

### Values and types

Every programming language has values and every value has a type:

```javascript
undefined // undefined

null // null

true // boolean

123 // number

[1, 2, 3] // number[]

new Set(["abc"]) // Set<string>

{foo: [1, 2, 3]} // {foo: number[]}

const map = f => xs => xs.map(f);
const len = xs => xs.length;

map(len) (["b", "ba", "bar"]) // <string, number>(f: (x: string) => number) => (xs: string[]) => number[]
```
A type can be inhabited by either no value at all (`undefined`), one value (`null`) or any number of values. Since `undefined` indicates a type error in Javascript, we pretend it has no value.

### Value and type constructors

A value constructor takes no, one or more values and returns a new value. It exists at the term level of the language. In Javascript there is no difference between a value constructor and a normal function. However, in other more advanced functional languages there is one. A value constructor that takes no argument is just a typed constant like `true`/`false`.

A type constructor takes no, one or more types and returns a new type. It exists at the type level of the language. A type constructor that takes no types is just a proper type, i.e. all types are actually nullary type constructors. In the following example value constructors with increasing complexity are listed along with their type constructors denoted as comments. Later in this chapter we will see a custom tagged union type, which makes the distinction between type und value constructors more obvious:

```javascript
null // null

true // boolean

false // boolean

Array // A[]

Set // Set<A>

// custom data declarations

type Foo = <A>(xs: A[]) => ({ foo: A[] });
const Foo: Foo = xs => ({foo: xs});

interface NonEmpty<A> extends Array<A> {
  (x: A): [A]
}

class NonEmpty<A> extends Array<A> {
    constructor(x: A) {super(x)}
};
```
`null` is both a nullary type constructor (or just a proper type) and a nullary value constructor (or a typed constant). The type is only inhabited by a single value. `boolean` is also a proper type but inhabited by two values, namely the typed constants `true`/`false`.

`A[]` is a type constructor, because it needs a type (e.g. `string`) to create a proper type (`string[]`). `Array` is a value constructor, because it needs a value (e.g. `"foo"`) to create a new value (`["foo"]`).

In Javascript the only way to create custom types is to declare a new `Object` type, either by using object factories like `Foo` from the example above or by subclassing (see `NonEmpty`).

If a value constructor takes more than a single value, the associated type forms a product type:

```javascript
type Pair = <A, B>(x: A, y: B) => [A, B]; // type constructor
const Pair: Pair = (x, y) => [x, y]; // value constructor
```
 If a type constructor is associated with more than one value constructor, the underlying type forms a sum type:
 
```javascript
const True = {tag: "True"} as const
const False = {tag: "False"} as const;

type Bool = typeof True | typeof False; // two value constructors
```
A tagged union is an alternate way to declare booleans. Unfortunately Typescript is quite verbose regarding the declaration of tagged unions. Here is the succinct Haskell counterpart: `data Bool = False | True`.

Here is another data declaration of a tagged union. Functional linked `List`s comprise an unary type constructor as well as a nullary and an unary value constructor. Besides they have a recursive type definition, because `List<A>` occurs in the body of the `Cons` value constructor:

```javascript
const Nil = {tag: "Nil"} as const
const Cons = <A>(head: A) => (tail: List<A>) => ({tag: "Cons", head, tail} as const);

type List<A> = typeof Nil | typeof Cons;
```
### Higher-order type constructors

Just as functions can take other functions as arguments at the term level, type constructors can take other type constructors as parameters at the type level. In type theory parlance this is also referred to as higher-kinded types.

Taking the list type `List<A>` from the last example we can transform it into a higher-order one by abstracting from the `List` part: `T<A>`. This new type constructor has two parameters, one for a first-order type constructor (e.g. `List<A>`) and another for a proper type, which is then fed to this first-order type constructor. That means we abstracted from the type constructor by making it polymorphic as well. Such a generalized type constructor is applicable to a wider range of data structures, that is, we only need a single type definition to cover numerous specific data structures implementing this type.

Unfortunately, such higher-order type constructors cannot be expressed reasonably in Typescript. There is a workaround available in the community, however, personally I think it is too complex and establishes too great an indirection to be actually useful.

### Parametric polymorphism also known as generics

A parametric polymorphic value constructor or function acts uniformly on all types. As a result it must not know anything about its polymorphic arguments, because they can be of any type. While this strict form of polymorphism allows the definition of very generic combinators, it considerably narrwos down the possibilities of what you can do with these arguments. Parametric polymorphic arguments are expressed with type variables (e.g. `A` or `T`), which act like wildcards.

There is only a single first-order function, which is fully parametric polymorphic in its arguments: The identity function `id = <A>(x: A): A => x`, which simply puts a value into a function context. Parametric polymorphism needs higher-order functions to develop its full expressiveness:

```javascript
type arrMap = <A, B>(f: (x: A) => B) => (xs: A[]) => B[]
const arrMap: arrMap = f => xs => xs.map(f);
```
This is a quite polymorphic and elegant type declaration, even though it is obfuscated by Typescript's awkward notation.

### Ad-hoc polymorphism also known as name overloading

In its simplest form ad-hoc polymorphism simply means name overloading. An overloaded name is a mapping from a name to several types and their implementations. In Javascript we cannot overload names, but there are a couple of overloaded built-in operators:

```javascript
// well typed

123 === 123;
"foo" === "foo";
true === false;

123 === "foo"; // well typed, but should be a type error
```
In Typescript we can declare overloaded functions and methods:

```javascript
function eq(x: string, y: string): boolean;
function eq(x: number, y: number): boolean;
function eq(x: boolean, y: boolean): boolean;

function eq(x: any, y: any) { return x === y };

// well typed

eq(123, 123);
eq("foo", "foo");
eq(true, false);

eq(123, "foo"); // type error
```

We start with a bunch of proper types and concert them to a single, polymorphic type by combining these proper types under a single name. As with parametric polymorphism name overloading develops its full expressiveness together with higher order functions:

```javascript
function eq(x: boolean, y: boolean): boolean;
function eq(x: number, y: number): boolean;
function eq(x: string, y: string): boolean;

function eq(x: any, y: any) { return x === y };

const arrEq = <A>(eq: (x: A, y: A) => boolean) => (xs: A[]) => (ys: A[]) => {
    const go = (b: boolean, i: number): boolean =>
        b === false ? false
            : i === xs.length ? true
                : go(eq(xs[i], ys[i]), i + 1);

    return xs.length !== ys.length
        ? false
        : go(true, 0);
};

// please note that we need a type cast here due to limited type inference in TS

arrEq(eq) ([1, 2, 3]) ([1, 2, 3]); // well typed
arrEq(eq) ([1, 2, 3]) (["foo", "bar", "baz"]); // type error
```

Compared to the previous example it works the other way around. We start with a parametric polymorphic higher order function and pass it an overloaded function `arrEq(eq)`, which renders the type variable `A` less polymorphic, namely ad-hoc polymorphic. You can think of such a partially applied function as one with a constraint on its type variable: The function still must not know anything about the proper type its type variable will be applied to except for the aspect implemented by the type class. Consequently such a function can only be invoked with types that have an instance of this very type class and its overloaded names - `eq` in the example above.

Type classes go beyond simple name overloading by giving the mapping from one name to many types itself a name. Now we can refer to this mapping or assign several overloaded names to it, that is, we can put overloaded names into a relation. A type that has an instance of such a type class must respect this relation and implement all overloaded names. Additionally we can express specific laws the overloaded functions of the type class must abide by. Or we can form type class hierarchies, where a subclass inherits overloaded names from a superclass.

In this course we will use a technique called dictionary passing style, because Typescript only supports runtime name overloading - the most primitive form of ad-hoc polymorphism. While dictionary passing style is as expressive as type classes it comes at the price of making your code more verbose. They act like explicit type classes.

### Subtype polymorphism also known as subtyping

Subtyping defines a subtype-supertype relationship between two types. This form of polymorphism is widely used in object-oriented programming. Various multi-paradigm languages with strong roots in functional programming incorporate different forms of subtype polymorphism in their type systems. However, in this course we will not engage any further with this topic.

### Row polymorphism

Row polymorphism enables record types to be polymorphic in their fields. Such a type accepts records with more fields than it has declared itself, provided these extra fields coincide for all involved records:

```javascript
type foo = { first: string, last: string };

const o = { first: "Foo", last: "Oof", age: 30 };
const p = { first: "Bar", last: "Rab", age: 45 };
const q = { first: "Baz", last: "Zab", gender: "m" };

const foo = <T extends foo>(o: T) => (p: T) =>
  `${o.first} ${o.last}`;

foo(o) (p); // type checks
foo(o) (q); // type error
```
The type variable `T` gathers all extra fields of the record type which are not part of the expected type. It is called a row variable. In order to type check all involved records including their row variables must have the same type. Downcasting a record type to one with fewer fields usually leads to information loss. With row polymorphism this can be avoided, since the full type information is maintained within the row variable.
