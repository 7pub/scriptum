## Basics on Type/Kind Systems and Polymorphism

Functional programming is type directed programming, hence we need to acquire some type theoretical background, even though the first part of this course relies on untyped code. If we introduce types we must distinguish the type from the term (or value) level. The type level can be quite confusing but luckily both type and term level are similar to each other, because each concept at the type level has a correspondence at the term level. Please note that I will use Typescript notation to annotate types.

### Structural versus nominal type system

There are two major classes of type systems: Nominal and structural ones. A nominal type system determines type equivalence by considering only the names of types. A structural type system determines type equivalence by considering only the structure of types:

```javascript
type foo = {x: number};
type bar = {x: number};
```
In the example above `foo` and `bar` are nominally non-equivalent but structurally equivalent, that is, with nominal typing values of `foo` and `bar` are of different type, whereas with structural typing they are of the same type.

Please note that most type systems are a blend of nominal and structural typing.

### Monomorphic types

A monomorphic type or in short a type is like a constant at the term level. It is complete and can no longer be modified:

```javascript
undefined // undefined

null // null

123 // number

[1, 2, 3] // number[]

new Set(["foo"]) // Set<string>

{foo: [1, 2, 3]} // {foo: number[]}

const map = f => xs => xs.map(f);
const len = xs => xs.length;

map(len) (["f", "fo", "foo"]) // <string, number>(f: (x: string) => number) => (xs: string[]) => number[]
```
A type can be inhabited by either no value at all (`undefined`), one value (`null`) or any number of values (`number`). Please note that I pretend that `undefined` would be no value, because it denotes a type error and should terminate the program immediately.

I left out the type for `map` and `len`, because their types are not monomorphic but polymorphic.

### Polymorphic types

The motivation for polymorphism in type systems comes from the idea of generalization: We always strive to apply a concept to a wider range of scenarios. A value is polymorphic if there is more than one monomorphic type it can have.

#### First-order type constructors

A first order type constructor or in short type constructor also known as parameterized type is like a function at the term level. A type constructor takes one or more types and returns a new type. Let us examine the two polymorphic types of the last example:

```javascript
const map = f => xs => xs.map(f); // <A, B>(f: (_: A) => B) => (xs: A[]) => B[]
const len = xs => xs.length; // <A>(xs: A[]) => number

len("foo"); // number
map(len) (["f", "fo", "foo"]) // <string, number>(f: (x: string) => number) => (xs: string[]) => number[]
```
Both functons have polymorphic types as well but we are only interested in the array type constructors inside. `Array<A>` takes a single type `A` and returns a new type. `A` is a type variable that serves as a placeholder for a type yet to be provided. In the example above `string` is passed to the type constructor, which in turn yields `string[]` as new monomorphic type. For `map` the array type constructor is applied twice. At first the yielded type is determined by the type of `f`'s domain (`string`) and for the second time by `f`'s codomain (`number`).

#### Higher-order type constructors

Just like higher-order functions can take other functions as arguments at the term level, higher-order type constructors can take other type constructors as arguments at the type level. This is possible, because both functions and type constructors are first class. In type theory parlance this is also referred to as higher-kinded types. We will learn about the kind system in a later section of this chapter.

Let us take the arry type constructor `A[]` and transform it into higher-order one. First we pick the more verbose form `Array<A>`. Then we abstract from the type constructor itself (`Array`) by replacing it with another type variable: `T<A>`. This is a type that takes a first class type constructor function `T` and a type `A` to produce a new type. Please note that I use a hypothetical Typescript notation, because its type system does not support higher-order type constructors. Just like a higher-order function is more general than a first-order one, a higher-order type constructor can produce a wider variety of types than its first-order counterpart.

Please note that there is a workaround available in the Typescript community to mimic higher-order type constructors. However, I consider it to be too complex to be demonstrated in this chapter.

#### Higher-rank type constructors

Our new gained ability to pass first class type constructors to higher-order type constructors is somewhat limited:

```
type foo = <A, B>(f: (_: A) => string) => (x: A) => (y: B) => string;
const foo:foo = f => x => y => f(x) + f(y); // type  error
//                                      ^
```
Only `foo`'s caller can decide which type to pick for `f`, i.e. we cannot pass polymorphic type constructors around, only monomorphic ones. Higher-rank type constructors enable first class polymorphic type constructors by introducing scopes for type variables on the left-hand side of the `=>` operator. This kind of polymorphism is a bit harder to grasp, because it has no equivalent at the term level. Typescript does not support higher-rank polymorphic types but in the following example I use curly braces as a hypothetical annotation extension to illustrate the idea:

```
type foo = <A, B>(f: {(_: A) => string)} => (x: A) => (y: B) => string;
const foo:foo = f => x => y => f(x) + f(y); // type checks
```
Now `(_: A) => string` has its own scope and is not affected by the type the outer `A` is assigned to when `x` is passed.

#### Parametric polymorphism also known as generics

A parametric polymorphic function acts uniformly on all types. As a result it must not know anything about its polymorphic arguments, because they can be of any type - a property which is referred to as parametricity. While this strict form of polymorphism allows the definition of very generic functions, it considerably narrows down the possibilities of what you can do with these polymorphic arguments.

There is only a single first-order function, which is fully parametric polymorphic in its arguments: The identity function `id = <A>(x: A): A => x`, which simply puts a value into a function context. Parametric polymorphism is much more useful in connection with higher-order functions:

```javascript
type arrMap = <A, B>(f: (x: A) => B) => (xs: A[]) => B[]
const arrMap: arrMap = f => xs => xs.map(f);
```
`arrMap` is parametric polymorphic in `A` and `B`.

#### Ad-hoc polymorphism also known as name overloading

Name overloading maps several different types to a single function or constructor name. The mapping is either resolved at compile or at runtime. Here is a simple example of name overloading with runtime resolving in Typescript:

```javascript
function eq(x: string, y: string): boolean;
function eq(x: number, y: number): boolean;
function eq(x: boolean, y: boolean): boolean;

function eq(x: any, y: any) {
    if (typeof x === "string")
        return x === y;

    else if (typeof x === "number")
        return x === y;

    else if (typeof x === "boolean")
        return x === y;

    else
        throw TypeError();
};

// type checks

eq(123, 123);
eq("foo", "foo");
eq(true, false);

eq(123, "foo"); // type error
```

You might have noticed that the conditions used in the abvove example is redundant, because Javascript's `===` operator itself is overloaded. But unlike the `eq` function `===` is statically bound, hence we can just write:

```javascript
function eq(x: string, y: string): boolean;
function eq(x: number, y: number): boolean;
function eq(x: boolean, y: boolean): boolean;

function eq(x: any, y: any) {
    return x === y;
};

// type checks

eq(123, 123);
eq("foo", "foo");
eq(true, false);

eq(123, "foo"); // type error
```

Statically bound name overloading is less verbose but Typescript does not support it.

#### Bounded parametric polymorphism also known as type classes

**[Editor's note: this section needs edit]**

There is a more powerful approach to achieve ad-hoc polymorphism, which is called bounded parametric polymorphism or simply type classes. Type classes go beyond name overloading by giving the mapping from a name to several types itself a name. Now we can refer to this mapping and, for instance, subsume several overloaded names under this name or assign algebraic laws to it. We can also define type class hierarchies to avoid repetition. Type classes have turned out to be the superior way to encode ad-hoc polymorphism.

TODO: mention constraints on polymorphic types (or constraints on generics)

In this course we will use a technique called dictionary passing style, because it is far more beginner friendly and can be easier expressed with Typescript. While the dictionary passing style is even more expressive than type classes it comes at the price of making code more verbose. Type dictionaries act like explicit type classes.

#### Subtype polymorphism also known as subtyping

Subtyping defines a subtype-supertype relationship between two types. This form of polymorphism is widely used in object-oriented programming or in structural type systems of multi-paradigm languages. Since subtyping does not have a great impact on functional programming, we will skip it in this course.

#### Row polymorphism

Row polymorphism enables record types to be polymorphic in their fields. Such a type accepts records that contain a superset of the demanded fields:

```javascript
type foo = { first: string, last: string };

const o = { first: "Foo", last: "Oof", age: 30 };
const p = { first: "Bar", last: "Rab", age: 45 };
const q = { first: "Baz", last: "Zab", gender: "m" };

const foo = <T extends foo>(o: T) => (p: T) =>
  `${o.first} ${o.last}`;

foo(o) (p); // type checks
foo(o) (q); // type error
```

The difference of the field set is stored in a so called row variable (`T` in the above example), i.e. a row polymorphic type is polymorphic in its row variable. This way there is no information loss like with traditional subtyping.

### Value constructors

A value constructor takes no, one or several values and returns a new tagged value that contains the passed values. The tag is not part of the type system and thus not erased during compilation. This way a type can have different value constructors whose values can be distinguished from each other at runtime. The ability to create its own tagged values of a certain type is the main difference between functions and value constructors. The following listing includes several native Javascript constructors:

```javascript
null
true
false
Number
Array
```
`null` is special because there is no difference between the value and type constructor, because both are nullary functions and thus constants at the term and at the type level respectively. `true`/`false` are also special, because the underlying `Boolean` type is the only native Javascript type with two "value constructors". They are nullary constructors and thus merely constants. I put "value constructor" in parenthesis, because Javascript does not distinguish value and type constructors due to the lack of a type system altogether.

In Javascript the only way to create custom types is to declare a new `Object` type, either by using object factories or subclassing through the `extends` keyword.

### Kinds - the type of types

If we abstract further and assign a type to each type we get a system that is referred to as kind system. A kind is simply denoted by an asterisk `*`. Each monomorphic type has kind `*`. An unary type constructor has kind `* => *` and a binary one has kind `* => * => *`. The number of asterisks corresponds to the number of type variables + 1 in the original type - it is that easy. But how can we give higher-order type constructors a proper kind? We just put the type constructor argument into parentheses. `(* => *) => * => *` is read as: An unary type constructor that takes another unary type constructor and a type and returns a new type.

### Parametricity, type constraints and applicability

Parametricity has a somewhat strange effect on the applicability of polymorphic functions: The more constraints the type of a polymorphic functions has the more applicable the function gets. This is counterintuitive. It should rather be the other way around. In order to understand this strange correlation we must look at the type and term level separately. Parametricity only applies to the type level and enforces that a function does not know anything about its polymorphic arguments. Type constraints interfere with parametricity, because they tell the function how a constrained polymorphic argument behaves under certain circumstances. Consequently, the more type constraints a function has at the type level the more it knows about its polymorphic arguments and the more useful behavior it can exhibit at the term level.
