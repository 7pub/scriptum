## Lazy Evaluation on Demand

**[Editor's note: this chapter is being edited]**

Lazy evaluation means that expressions are evaluated

* only when needed
* just enough
* only once

The next sections will discuss each point in detail.

#### Normal order evaluation

Applicative order is the common evaluation strategy of imperative and multi-paradigm languages. It evaluates all subexpressions passed to a function as its arguments right before the function is called.

Normal order evaluation passes argument subexpressions to functions as they are and proceeds with their evaluation only if the results are actually needed within the function body:

```javascript
// hypothetical normal evaluation order in Javascript

const add = x => y => x + y;

const foo = add(2 + 3) (4 * 5); // A
//              ^^^^^   ^^^^^ subexpressions
const main = foo + 0; // B
```
With normal evaluation order both subexpressions are not evaluated but passed to `add` as is (line `A`). However, in line `B` the evaluation is forced, because the result of the addition is needed. Let us further look into the evaluation process:

```javascript
foo + 0

// first add's body is inlined with the unevaluated arguments

((2 + 3) + (4 * 5)) + 0

// then the resulting expression is further reduced to normal form

(5 + 20) + 0
25 + 0
25 // normal form
```
#### Weak Head Normal Form (WHNF)

Lazy evaluation also means to evaluate subexpressions just enough, that is to pause evaluation as early as possible. An expression need not to be further reduced when the outermost level is a lambda abstraction. Such an expression is in WHNF, that is it may contain unevaluated subexpressions referred to as thunks. Taking the above example the add function call is in WHNF:

```javascript
// hypothetical WHNF in Javascript

// WHNF

add(2 + 3) (4 * 5)
add(2 + 3)

// not in WHNF

add(2 + 3) (4 * 5) + 1
```
The expression in the last line is not in WHNF, because the outermost level is not a lambda abstraction but the `+` operator with two operands. Hence the expressions require further reduction. Since the `+` operator eagerly requires both operands to be fully evaluated the preceding `add` function call is forced to normal form.

#### Sharing

Lazy evaluation would be very inefficient if it had to evaluate the same subexpression each time it occurs in a function body. For that reason the result of once evaluated subexpressions is stored and shared within the same scope:

```javascript
const foo = x => [
  x + x,
  x - x,
  x * x];

foo(2 + 3);
```
The invocation of `foo` triggers the evaluation of `2 + 3` only once, even though it is used six times.

### Lambda abstractions

As we have seen lazyness defers the evaluation of subexpressions. When we squint hard enough this also applies to ordinary functions, because they are only evaluated when the required arguments are provided. This inherently lazy behavior allows us to partially apply them:

```javascript
const add = x => y => x + y,
  add2 = add(2);
```
#### Eta abstractions

`f` and `x => f(x)` are not the same when it comes to evaluation in a strictly evaluated language like Javascript. The latter renders a function slightly more lazy:

```javascript
const foldMap = f => acc => ix => {
  for (let [i, x] of ix)
    acc = f(acc) (x);

  return acc;
};

const arrSnoc = xs => x =>
  (xs.push(x), xs);

const mapToArr =
  foldMap(arrSnoc) ([]);

const mapToArr_ = ix =>
//                ^^
  foldMap(arrSnoc) ([]) (ix);
//                      ^^^^

const foo = new Map([[0, "foo"], [1, "bar"], [2, "baz"]]);

mapToArr(foo);
mapToArr_(foo);

mapToArr(foo); // ["foo", "bar", "baz", "foo", "bar", "baz"]
mapToArr_(foo); // ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/MeanNoxiousChord)

`mapToArr` gets a fesh array as accumulator each time it is called and hence keeps the side effect caused by `arrSnoc` local. Adding redundant lambda abstractions to a derived function is called eta abstraction and the opposite operation eta reduction.

#### Function composition

You can think of function composition as the introduction rule of the function type. If you compose two existing functions you create a new one. Since functions are inherently lazy you can dynamically create new lazy types exhibiting new lazy behavior:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const flip = f => y => x => f(x) (y);

const inc = x => x + 1;
const strRepeat = n => s => s.repeat(n);

const main = comp(
  flip(strRepeat) ("Hi"))
    (inc);

// nothing evaluated yet

main(2); // "HiHiHi"
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WebbedDryDiskdrive)

#### Continuation passing style

Can we defer the function application even further?

```javascript
const compk = f => g => x => k =>
  k(f(g(x)));
//  ^^^^^^^ deferring effect

const inc = x => x + 1;

const sqr = x => x * x;

const id = x => x;

const main = compk(
  sqr) (inc) (4);

// main is still unevaluated

main(id); // 25
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/AppropriateBestObjectmodel)

CPS is a function encoding and allows us to control the rest of the computation and thus literally the rest of the program. This way we are able to compose arbitrarily complex compositions, which are technically nested funcion call trees. We will learn about continuation passing style in a subsequent chapter of this course.

### Description of computations

Function call trees are defered function applications that are only evaluated when the initial value is provided. When we construct such computations we neither need to provide a value nor evaluate the computation in place. We defer it and still add types and new behavior layer by layer.

What is a proper notion of such a computation? It is not a normal computation anymore but a description of a computation. Since function call trees are just nested functions which are just functions which are oordinary values we can pass them around like data. We create and pass around descriptions of computations and it is up to the consumer of this structures to provide the necessary value to actually evaluated them.

### From nullary functions to implicit thunks

Using the inherent lazyness of functions for our own benefit is a very powerful technique and one of the major effects that the paradigm has on your code. However, we would like to have a more fine-grained control over the evaluation time of an arbitrarily expression. Javascript pursues an eager evaluation strategy, that is, we need to mimic lazy evaluation somehow. Usually functional programmers fall back to nullary functions under these circumstances:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x =>
  () => f(g(x));
  ^^ nullary function
```
Nullary functions are also referred to as thunks in Javascript. The type is infectious, because consumers of nullary functions need to apply them, even though there is no argument. Can we render lazy evaluated code more natural? We can indeed, provided we are willing to intercept property accesses and functions calls with the `Proxy` interface:

```javascript
// simplified version

class ThunkProxy {
  constructor() {
    this.memo = undefined;
  }

  get(g, k) {
    if (this.memo === undefined)
      this.memo = g();

    if (k === THUNK)
      return true;

    else if (k === Symbol.toPrimitive)
      return () => this.memo;

    else if (k === "valueOf")
      return () => this.memo;

    else return this.memo[k];
  }
}

const thunk = f =>
  new Proxy(f, new ThunkProxy());

const log = x =>
  (console.log("log", x), x);

const add = x => y =>
  thunk(() => log(x + y));

const mul = x => y =>
  thunk(() => log(x * y));

const main = add(add(2) (3)) (mul(4) (5)); // WHNF
//               ^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^ not immediately evaluated

// nothing logged yet!

main + 0; // logs 5, 20, 25 and yields 25
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/FarawayImmediateSyntax)

Please note that this is essentially the example from the beginning of this chapter, only it seems to be lazily evaluated. Is this already comparable with languages like Haskell, where lazyness is the default strategy? Let us verify whether we meet all three requirements of lazy evaluation, namely normal order, WHNF and sharing, before we get too excited:

```javascript
const log = x =>
  (console.log("evaluating x to", x), x);

const add = x => y =>
  thunk(() => log(x + y));

const mul = x => y =>
  thunk(() => x * y);

const foo = x => [
  x + x, // x is needed to process the operation
  x - x,
  mul(x) (x)]; // the result of the multiplication is not needed yet

const main = foo(add(2) (3)); // logs "evaluating x to 5" only once and yields [10, 0, thunk]

main.map(x => -x); // forces evaluation of the thunk and yields [-10, -0, -25]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/EasygoingUnhealthyAttribute)

`foo` evaluates its argument only when needed after the actual function invocation, i.e. it pursues normal evaluation order. `main` is in WHNF, because it contains an unevaluated thunk. `foo` evaluates its argument `x` only once and shares the result inside its scope. We have achieved proper lazy evaluation in Javascript. This is huge!

Mimicking lazy evaluation is not an end in itself though. How can we benefit from this alternative evaluation strategy in practice?

#### Guarded recursion

If you pass a reducing functon to fold that is non-strict in its second argument you get stack safety for free:

```javascript
// ARRAY

const arrFoldr_ = f => acc => xs => {
  const go = i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? acc
      : f(xs[i]) (thunk(() => go(i + 1)));

  return go(0);
};

const arrTake = n => xs => {
  const go = (acc, [y, ys]) =>
    y === undefined || acc.length === n
      ? acc
      : go(arrSnoc(y) (acc), ys);

  return go([], xs);
};

const arrSnoc = x => xs => (xs.push(x), xs);
const arrCons = head => tail => [head, tail];

// auxiliary functions

const add = x => y => x + y;

// MAIN

const xs = Array(1e5)
  .fill(0)
  .map((_, i) => i + 1);

const main = arrFoldr_(arrCons) ([]) (xs), // stack safe due to lazyness
  main2 = arrFoldr_(add) ([]) (xs); // stack overflow

arrTake(3) (main); // [1, 2, 3]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/ShadowyFlimsySmalltalk)

This trait of lazy evaluation is referred to as guarded recursion. This is equivalent with the tail call modulo cons optimization in non-strict languages. `main2` is not stack safe, because `add` is strict in both of its arguments.

##### Infinite recursion

With lazy evaluation different forms of infinite recursions are possible. Such algorithms can lead to quite natural and succinct implementations:

```javascript
const fix = f => thunk(() => f(fix(f)));

const fact = fix(go => n =>
  n === 0
    ? 1
    : n * go(n - 1));

fact(5); // 120
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/MurkyDetailedAutosketch)

The Fibonacci numbers as an infinite stream:

```javascript
const fibs = [0, [1, thunk(() => {
  const next = ([x, [y, ys]]) =>
    [x + y, thunk(() => next([y, ys]))];

  return next(fibs);
})]];

fibs[1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [0]; // 55
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WiltedDarkseagreenCoolingfan)

##### Incremental operations

Strictly evaluated languages need explicit incremental structures like iterators to lazily traverse a data structure. In a lazy evaluated setting we can just use the single linked `List`s to operate incrementally on its values:

```javascript
// union constructor

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

// LIST

const List = union("List");

const Nil = List("Nil", {});

const Cons = head => tail =>
  List(Cons, {head, tail});

const listFoldr_ = f => acc => {
  const go = xs =>
    match(xs, {
      Nil: _ => acc,
      Cons: ({head, tail}) => f(head) (thunk(() => go(tail)))
    });

  return go;
};

const arrTake = n => xs => {
  const go = (acc, {head, tail}) =>
    head === undefined || acc.length === n
      ? acc
      : go(arrSnoc(head) (acc), tail);

  return go([], xs);
};

const arrSnoc = x => xs => (xs.push(x), xs);

// auxiliary functions

const comp3 = f => g => h => x =>
  (console.log(x), f(g(h(x))));

const sqr = x => x * x;
const toStr = x => x + "";

// MAIN

const xs = Cons(1) (
  Cons(2) (
    Cons(3) (
      Cons(4) (
        Cons(5) (
          Cons(6) (
            Cons(7) (
              Cons(8) (
                Cons(9) (Nil)))))))));

const main = listFoldr_(
  comp3(Cons) (toStr) (sqr))
    (Nil);

arrTake(3) (main(xs)); // logs 1, 2, 3, 4 and yields ["1", "4", "9"]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/OffbeatShorttermRefactoring)

Each value is only passed once to the function composition and the entire computation short circuits as soon as just enough values are processed.

#### Enforce the evaluation

The mechanism I demonstrated in this chapter is based on creating explicit thunks and thus results in lazy evaluation on demand. The default evaluation strategy is still strict. Yet there might be some situations where we want both, lazy and eager evaluation on a case-by-case basis. The following combinator enables to programmatically convert a lazy function into a strict one:

```javascript
const PREFIX = "scriptum_";

const THUNK = PREFIX + "thunk";

const strict = thunk => {
  while (thunk[THUNK])
    thunk = thunk.valueOf();

  return thunk;
};
```
