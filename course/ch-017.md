## Combining Effects with Actions using Monad

### The limitation of applicative

In the chapter about applicatives we have learned that an applicative effect may depend on a previous effect but we cannot control an effect depending on a previous value. It turns out that despite this limitation applicative computations are applicable for a surprising number of scenarios. However, they are not always enough. We need a slightly less general, slightly more expressive alternative.

### Extending `Applicative` by `Monad`

Provided you have understood applicative functors it is only a minor step to comprehend monads. Their sole purpose is to overcome the limitation of applicatives. Before we take a close look into the `Monad` type class we will ascertain what they are not:

_Monads are no means to handle side effects!_

There are special types that do this. Monad and applicative are just two ways to combine these types.

#### From pure functions to actions

So far we lifted n-ary functions into the context of `n` applicative values. If the next effect should depend on the previous value we need more than a pure function. We need one that returns a value in an effectul context of the same type. This type of function is called action. An action is not impure but it may represent an effectful computation provided it is used in the right place:

```javascript
// pure function
const foo = x => x + 1;

// action
const bar = x => [x + 1];
```
We will learn during this chapter what this right place is.

#### The `join` operation

If we apply `map` to an action we get back a nested functorial context:

```javascript
const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

// Functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// MAIN

arrMap(x => [x, x])
  ([1, 2, 3]); // [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]
```

We need a way to join two effectul contexts of the same type into one. In our example the contexts are non-deterministic computations:

```javascript
const arrEmpty = () => [];

// Monad

const arrJoin = xs =>
  arrFold(arrAppend)
    (arrEmpty())
      (xs);

// MAIN

arrJoin(
  arrMap(x => [x, x])
    ([1, 2, 3])); // [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
```

#### The `chain` operation

Working with two combinators can occasionally be cumbersome. Let us combine them into a single combinator for convenience. `chain` takes an effectful context from a previous functorial computation and an action, transforms the value(s) inside the context and returns a new context of the same type with the transformed value(s) inside:

```javascript
// Monad

const arrChain = mx => fm =>
  arrFold(acc => x => arrAppend(acc) (fm(x))) ([]) (mx);

// MAIN

arrChain([1, 2, 3])
  (x => [x, x]); // [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/HarmoniousAdorableScript)

In other functional languages this combinator is called `flatmap`.

#### Monadic laws

### Value-effect dependency

Given are two effectul computations `F<A>` and `F<B>`. It applies:

```
F   is an effectul context
A/B are values inside effectful contexts
~   denotes a "x may depend on y" relation
-   denotes a "x depends on y" relation
</> denotes the direction of an dependency

Applicative allows:
F <~ F

Monad allows:
F <- F
A <~ F
```
### Function instance

### Monads at the type level

```
<   A, B>( f:   (x: A) => B ) => ( x:   A ) =>   B ; // function application
<F, A, B>( f:   (x: A) => B ) => (tx: F<A>) => F<B>; // functor lifting
<F, A, B>(tf: F<(x: A) => B>) => (tx: F<A>) => F<B>; // applicative lifting
<M, A, B>(ft: (x: A) => M<B>) => (tx: M<A>) => M<B>; // monadic joining
```
### Monadic evaluation order

### Action composition Ã  la Kleisli

The reason the `chain` and not `kleisli` is part of the `Monad` API is that the both operations, which are associated to `Functor` and `Applicative`, are function application rather than function composition.

### Abstracting from nested application
