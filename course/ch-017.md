## Dynamically Combining two Contexts with a Kleisi Arrow using Monad

### The limitation of applicative

### Extending applicative by monad

#### `join` and `chain` operation

#### Monadic laws

### Value dependency and order

### Monad at the type level

### Dynamic combination of contexts

### Abstracting from nested application

***

* instead of lifting a pure function into several contexts of the same type and combining them inside that context (applicative) a monadic computation forms this nested structure itself and can create a context itself, outside of the context so to speak
* while applicative is object to the context monad is  subject
* monads can be commutative (reader)
* monads don't make a function pure, a special type like `IO` does that, which you cannot escape from (`IO a -> a` is not possible)
* a functor is a semantics machine and applicative/monad are ways to sequence this semantics (statically or dynamically respectively)
* a monadic action creates its own context and thus is the context or at least part of the context.
* an action is aware of both `>>=` and the context, because it controls `>>=` and creates its own context as its result value
* monad is non-deterministic in terms of context
* can short circuit everywhere independently of `chain`'s specific implementation
* as opposed to applicative monad depends on the result of the previous computation
