## Dynamically Combining two Contexts with a Kleisi Arrow using Monad

### The limitation of applicative

In the chapter about applicatives we have learned that an applicative effect may depend on a previous effect and an applicative value may depend on a previous value but we cannot create dependencies between effects and values. Both aspects are strictly separated from each other. An applicative effect can never depend on an applicative value and the other way around. It turns out that applicative computations are applicable in a surprising number of scenarios. However, they are not always enough. We need a slightly less general, slightly more expressive alternative.

### Extending applicative by monad

Provided you have understood applicative functors it is only a minor step to comprehend monads. The additional expressiveness they entail allows them to overcome the shortcomming of applicatives. Monadic effects may depend on previous monadic values and vice versa.

#### The `join` operation

#### The `chain` operation

#### Kleisli arrows

#### Monadic laws

### Value-effect dependency

Given are two effectul computations `F<A>` and `F<B>`. It applies:

```
F is an effectul context
A/B are values inside effectful contexts
~> denotes a "x is dependent on y" relation
<~ denotes a "y is dependent on x" relation

Applicative allows:
F <~> F
A <~  B

Monad allows:
F <~> F
A <~  B
A <~  F
```
### Monads at the type level

### Monadic evaluation order

### Abstracting from nested application

***

* instead of lifting a pure function into several contexts of the same type and combining them inside that context (applicative) a monadic computation forms this nested structure itself and can create a context itself, outside of the context so to speak
* while applicative is object to the context monad is  subject
* monads can be commutative (reader)
* monads don't make a function pure, a special type like `IO` does that, which you cannot escape from (`IO a -> a` is not possible)
* a functor is a semantics machine and applicative/monad are ways to sequence this semantics (statically or dynamically respectively)
* a monadic action creates its own context and thus is the context or at least part of the context.
* an action is aware of both `>>=` and the context, because it controls `>>=` and creates its own context as its result value
* monad is non-deterministic in terms of context
* can short circuit everywhere independently of `chain`'s specific implementation
* as opposed to applicative monad depends on the result of the previous computation
* flattens or joins to contexts
* compare (a -> M b) -> M a -> M b with F (a -> b) -> F a -> F b
* use the 2-notion of exp example of applicative once with `of` and once without `of`
