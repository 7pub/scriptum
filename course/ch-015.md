## Accumulating, Aggregating and Picking with Monoid

If we have two values we can either accumulate (e.g. `[2, 3]`), aggregate (e.g. `2 + 3`) or pick one of them (e.g. `[2, 3] [0]`). All these methods are notions of the same broader concept of combining things, because they have two common properties that we are going to examine in this chapter. With the `Monoid` type class we can write code that is agnostic about the method we will actually use.

### Appending with identity

The `Monoid` type class comprises two methods:

```javascript
const append = x => y => ...
const empty = ...;
```
The `append` function takes two values of the same type and returns a combined value of this type. The crucial property of this operator is its associativity, which allows an in-parallel processing of a greater number of values. Please note that appending as a term is a bit too narrow to cover the use cases of the operation, so do not take it literally.

`empty` is the identity element of the respective monoid, i.e. the neutral element that has no effect when applied to `append`. Applying the identity to an accumulation or aggregation means that it does not change. In the context of picking it means to have no choice. Here are simple examples for combining values by aggregating them:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const sumEmpty = () => 0;

sumAppend(sumAppend(2) (3)) (4); // 9
sumAppend(2) (sumAppend(3) (4)); // 9
sumAppend(10) (sumEmpty()); // 10

const prodAppend = x => y => x * y
const prodEmpty = () => 1;

prodAppend(prodAppend(2) (3)) (4); // 24
prodAppend(2) (prodAppend(3) (4)); // 24
prodAppend(10) (prodEmpty()); // 10
```
Both addition and multiplication of natural numbers have an associative operation and an identity element and thus form a monoid. Moreover, a single type can have more than one meaningful monoid. You might have already wondered why `empty` requires a nullary function also known as thunk. In a referential transparent language it can just be a value. However, in Javascript we prefer to get a fresh array every time we access `empty`.

Please note that only `empty` is an immediate part of the `Monoid` type class, whereas `append` is inherited by `Semigroup`, which is in turn a superclass of `Monoid`. Both type classes complement each other and are so closely connected that we often just talk about `Monoid` though. There are types that lack an identity element and thus only have a `Semigroup` instance, but later in this chapter we will learn how to lift every `Semigroup` into a `Monoid`.

### Type level

At the type level a `Monoid` is a parameterized type with a single type parameter `A`. As opposed to `Functor` there is no distinction of the context, because the type class is only interested in values. All it takes for a type to be a value is the associative binary operation and the corresponding identity element:

```
type append<A> = (_: A) => (_: A) => A;
type empty<A> = () => A;
```
Combining values is such a fundamental concept that it reoccurs in other context aware type classes like `Alternative` or `MonadPlus`. We will look into them in later chapters of this course.

### The `Array` instance

Arrays in terms of monoids are pretty much self-explanatory:

```javascript
// Monoid

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const arrPrepend = ys => xs =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const arrEmpty = () => [];

// MAIN

arrAppend([1, 2, 3]) ([4, 5, 6]); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

arrPrepend([1, 2, 3]) ([4, 5, 6]); // [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]

arrAppend([1, 2, 3]) (arrEmpty()); // [1, 2, 3]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/FatalWindingLight)

The array instance of `Monoid` combines values by accumulating them.

### The `Pred` instance

The predicate function instance is a bit more interesting:

```javascript
// record constructor

const record = (type, o) =>
  (o[type.name || type] = type.name || type, o);

// PRED

const Pred = pred => record(Pred, {pred});

// Monoid

const predAppend = tp => tq =>
  Pred(x => tp.pred(x) && tq.pred(x));

const predEmpty = () => Pred(_ => true);

// auxiliary functions

const numLte_ = y => x => x <= y;

const numGte_ = y => x => x >= y;

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

// predicate function

const numBetween = (x, y) => predAppend(
  Pred(numLte_(y)))
    (Pred(numGte_(x)));

// MAIN

const main = predAppend(
  numBetween(5, 10))
    (Pred(isEven));

main.pred(6); // true
main.pred(7); // false
main.pred(12); // false
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/AggravatingAquamarineSystemadministrator)

A predicate is an unary function wrapped in a `Pred` value to distinguish it from regular functions. Predicates are fixed in the type of their codomain, i.e. they always return a boolean value. The `Monoid` instance let us compose simple predicates to build more complex ones. The `Pred` instance of `Monoid` combines values by allowing to pick.

The `Pred` type seems to be just a simple object wrapper but adds type safety to our code, because we cannot use predicates in lieu of normal functions anymore, or use them in a context where booleans are meant to be combined with the `||` operator. Moreover it renders code more declarative, because of the explicit denotation.

### Define multidimensional orderings

#### `Comparator` type

First we declare a comparator type to avoid using Javascript's ordering protocol `1`/`0`/`-1`. It happens that `Comparator` forms a monoid:

```javascript
// union constructor

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

// COMPARATOR

const Comparator = union("Comparator");

const LT = Comparator("LT", {valueOf: () => -1});

const EQ = Comparator("EQ", {valueOf: () => 0});

const GT = Comparator("GT", {valueOf: () => 1});

// Monoid

const ctorAppend = tx => ty => 
  match(tx, {
    LT: _ => LT,
    EQ: _ => ty,
    GT: _ => GT
  });

const ctorEmpty = () => EQ;
```
#### The `Compare` instance

`Compare` is a binary function type that returns values of type `Comparator`. It forms itself a monoid and returns a monoid, that is, we can combine `Compare` values as well as their return values to form multidimensional orderings:

```javascript
// COMPARE

const Compare = cmp => record(
  Compare,
  {cmp});

// Monoid

const cmpAppend = tx => ty =>
  Compare(x => y => ctorAppend(tx.cmp(x) (y)) (ty.cmp(x) (y)));

const cmpEmpty = () => _ => _ => ctorEmpty();

// auxiliary functions

const _let = f => f();

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

// Comparator functions

const byNatural = Compare(x => y =>
  x < y ? LT
    : x > y ? GT
    : EQ);

const byEven = Compare(x => y =>
  isEven(x) && !isEven(y) ? GT
    : !isEven(x) && isEven(y) ? LT
    : EQ);

// MAIN

const xs = [4, 8, 2, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1, 7, 0];

xs.sort(
  (x, y) =>
   cmpAppend(byEven)
     (byNatural).cmp(x) (y)); // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8];
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/ImpartialInvolvedProgrammingmacro)

Please recall the function type here: We are dealing with binary functions that return a fixed return type and we can still combine as we see fit. Allowing different forms of function composition is one of the strong suites of functional programming.

Please note that I used Javascript's built-in destructive sort method, because I treat native arrays as a mutable data type. You need to copy the array first, if you want to keep mutations local. There is still room for improvements of course. We could have used a more general `sortBy` function for instance.

### Simplifying `Foldable`

Monoids have a wide range of application. Simplyfing folds is one of them:

```javascript
const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const arrEmpty = () => [];

const arrFoldM = ({append, empty}) => xs =>
  arrFold(append) (empty()) (xs);

const xs = [1,2,3,4,5];

const add = x => y => x + y,
  empty = () => 0;

arrFoldM({append: add, empty}) (xs); // 15
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/LargeForestgreenDecompilers#index.js)

Please note that I have to apply an eta abstraction to `arrFoldM` in order to provide a fresh empty array at every invocation. This is necessary, because I treat `Array` as a  mutable data type according to its design.

### Semigroup lifting

There are some types that only form a semigroup but not a monoid. However, we can easily promote such types to monoids using the polymorphic `optmAppend` and `optmEmpty` operations:

```javascript
// union constructor

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

// OPTION

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});

const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// FIRST

const First = first => record(First, {first});

// Semigroup

const fstAppend = tx => ty => tx; 

// lift into Monoid

const optmAppend = append => tx => ty =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => ty,

    Some: ({some: x}) => match(ty, {
      None: _ => tx,
      Some: ({some: y}) => Some(append(x) (y))
    })
  });

const optmEmpty = () => None;

// auxiliary function

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

// MAIN

const xs = [Some("foo"), Some("bar"), Some("baz")],
  ys = [None, Some("bar"), Some("baz")],
  zs = [];

const main = arrFold(
  optmAppend(fstAppend))
    (optmEmpty());

main(xs); // Some("foo")
main(ys); // Some("bar")
main(zs); // None
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/SphericalComplexPrinter)

The crucial part is that `optmEmpty` serves as the missing identity element.

### Commutative monoids and `Dual`

While monoids have to be associative, they are not necessarily commutative, that is, for most `Monoid` instances the following holds:

`append(x) (y) !== append(y) (x)`

Consequently it makes sense to define an operation with flipped arguments. We can achieve this either by manually supplying both operations or by declaring a type that reverses the arguments programmatically:

```javascript
const record = (type, o) =>
  (o[type.name || type] = type.name || type, o);

const Dual = dual => record(Dual, {dual});

const dualAppend = append => tx => ty =>
  Dual(append(ty.dual) (tx.dual));

const dualEmpty = empty => () => Dual(empty());

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);
  
const arrEmpty = () => [];

const arrPrepend = dualAppend(arrAppend);

arrPrepend(
  Dual([1, 2, 3))
    (Dual([4, 5, 6])); // Dual([4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3])
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/HealthyGreenHack)

Obviously, `Dual` adds some noise to the calling site. For that reason I prefer the manual approach and declare both `append` and `prepend` operations for each type in the scriptum library.

### Monoid homomorphisms

Suppose we have two monoidal types and there exists a function to transform one monoid into the other while the monoidal structure is preserved. Such a function is called a monoid homomorphism. As we have already learned the monoid structure consists of an associative binary operation and an identity element. Here are the equations that must hold for both properties. `hom` is the said transformation function:

```javascript
hom(append1(x) (y)) === append2(hom(x)) (hom(y))
hom(empty1) === empty2
```
Let us examine an example that complies with and another one that violates these laws.

#### `Array`/`Number` under addition

The `length` function is a monoid homomorphism between `Array` and `Number`:

```javascript
const arrEmpty = () => [];

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const sumEmpty = () => 0;

const sumAppend = x => y => x + y;

const length = xs => xs.length;

length(arrAppend([1, 2, 3]) ([4, 5])) ===
  sumAppend(length([1, 2, 3])) (length([4, 5])); // true
  
length(arrEmpty()) === sumEmpty(); // true
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/TestyViolentReference)

`length` meets the above criteria and is thus a valid monoid homomorphism.

#### `Task`/`Parallel`

`Task` represents asynchronous computations which are processed in sequence. Its monoid instance lifts two normal values and combines them within an asynchronous computation using their corresponding monoid operation. The `Monoid` instance looks as follows:

```javascript
// TASK

const Task = task => record(
  Task,
  thisify(o => {
    o.task = (res, rej) =>
      task(x => {
        o.task = k => k(x);
        return res(x);
      }, rej);
    
    return o;
  }));

// Monoid

const taskAppend = append => tx => ty =>
  Task((res, rej) =>
    tx.task(x =>
      ty.task(y =>
        res(append(x) (y)), rej), rej));

const taskEmpty = empty =>
  () => Task((res, rej) => res(empty()));
```
`Parallel` represents asynchronous computations which are processed in parallel. Its monoid instance picks the result value of the faster one of two asynchronous computations. It encodes the idea of a race monoid. The `Monoid` instance looks as follows:

```javascript
// PARALLEL

const Parallel = par => record(
  Parallel,
  thisify(o => {
    o.par = (res, rej) =>
      par(x => {
        o.par = k => k(x);
        return res(x);
      }, rej);
    
    return o;
  }));

// primitive combinator

const parOr = tx => ty => {
  const guard = (res, rej) => [
    x => (
      isRes || isRej
        ? false
        : (isRes = true, res(x))),
    e =>
        isRes || isRej
          ? false
          : (isRej = true, rej(e))];

  let isRes = false,
    isRej = false;

  return Parallel(
    (res, rej) => (
      tx.par(...guard(res, rej)),
      ty.par(...guard(res, rej))));
};

// Monoid

const raceAppend = tx => ty =>
  Parallel((res, rej) =>
    parOr(tx) (ty)
      .par(x => res(x), rej));

const raceEmpty = () => Parallel((res, rej) => null);
```
Can we create a homomorphism between both monoids?

```javascript
const taskParallel = tx =>
  Parallel((res, rej) => tx.task(x => res(x), rej));
```
`taskParallel` seems to be a promising candidate, but does it preserve the monoidal structure?

```javascript
const delayTask = f => ms => x =>
  Task((res, rej) => setTimeout(comp(res) (f), ms, x));

const delayParallel = f => ms => x =>
  Parallel((res, rej) => setTimeout(comp(res) (f), ms, x));

const taskInc = delayTask(x => x + 1) (20);

const taskSqr = delayTask(x => x * x) (200);

const parInc = delayParallel(x => x + 1) (10);

const parSqr = delayParallel(x => x * x) (100);

const sumAppend = x => y => x + y;

const sumEmpty = () => 0;

parAppend(
  taskParallel(taskSqr(5)))
    (taskParallel(taskInc(5)))
      .par(console.log); // logs 6

taskParallel(
  taskAppend(sumAppend)
    (taskSqr(5))
      (taskInc(5)))
        .par(console.log); // logs 31
  
6 === 31; // false, does not preserve the structure
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/SelfreliantPristineMarketing)

No, it does not. `taskParallel` is not a monoid homomorphism but just an unprincipled transformation from `Task` to `Parallel`.

### Managing several instances per type

Scriptum uses directory passing style and hence can define several monoid instances per type. Consequently we can spare type wrappers in many cases and just use different prefixes for different instances:

```javascript
const allEmpty = () => true;
const anyEmpty = () => false;

const allAppend = x => y => x && y;
const anyAppend = x => y => x || y;
```
However, for some cases I will still use type wrappers, because it makes the code more declarative and more type safe:

```javascript
const Pred = pred => record(Pred, {pred});

const predEmpty = () => Pred(_ => true);

const predAppend = tp => tq =>
  Pred(x => tp.pred(x) && tq.pred(x));
```
