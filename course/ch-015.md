## Accumulating, Aggregating and Picking with Monoid

**[Editor's note: This chapter needs editing]**

If we have two values we can either accumulate (e.g. `[2, 3]`), aggregate (e.g. `2 + 3`) or pick one of them (e.g. `[2, 3] [0]`). All these methods are notions of the same broader concept of combining things, because they have two common properties that we are going to examine in this chapter. With the `Monoid` type class we can write code that is agnostic about the method we will actually use.

### Appending with identity

The `Monoid` type class comprises two methods:

```javascript
const append = x => y => ...
const empty = ...;
```
The `append` function takes two values of the same type and returns a combined value of this type. The crucial property of this operator is its associativity, which allows an in-parallel processing of a greater number of values. Please note that appending as a term is a bit too narrow to cover the use cases of the operation, so do not take it literally.

`empty` is the identity element of the respective monoid, i.e. the neutral element that has no effect when applied to `append`. Applying the identity to an accumulation or aggregation means that it does not change. In the context of picking it means to have no choice. Here are simple examples for combining values by aggregating them:

```javascript
const sumAppend = x => y => x + y
const sumEmpty = () => 0;

sumAppend(sumAppend(2) (3)) (4); // 9
sumAppend(2) (sumAppend(3) (4)); // 9
sumAppend(10) (sumEmpty()); // 10

const prodAppend = x => y => x * y
const prodEmpty = () => 1;

prodAppend(prodAppend(2) (3)) (4); // 24
prodAppend(2) (prodAppend(3) (4)); // 24
prodAppend(10) (prodEmpty()); // 10
```
Both addition and multiplication of natural numbers have an associative operation and an identity element and thus form a monoid. Moreover, a single type can have more than one meaningful monoid. You might have already wondered why `empty` requires a nullary function also known as thunk. In a referential transparent language it can just be a value. However, in Javascript we prefer to get a fresh array every time we access `empty`.

Please note that only `empty` is an immediate part of the `Monoid` type class, whereas `append` is inherited by `Semigroup`, which is in turn a superclass of `Monoid`. Both type classes complement each other and are so closely connected that we often just talk about `Monoid` though. There are types that lack an idenity element and thus only have a `Semigroup` instance, but later in this chapter we will learn how to lift every `Semigroup` into a `Monoid`.

### Type level
***
At the type level the `Monoid` properties just operate on polymorphic values of the shape `A`. There is no distinction between value and context as `Functor` does with `F<A>`. For monoids a value is just a value without any additional semantics:

```
type append<A> = (_: A) => (_: A) => A;
type empty<A> = () => A;
```
The difference in their types reflect the different notions of computations both type classes capture. Where `Monoid` is about combining values `Functor` is about defining context. Both type classes belong to the most fundamental ones in functional programming and it probably makes a lot of sense to combine their notions to obtain further meaningful ones. As a matter of fact this is exactly what many subclasses of `Functor` do. They form variations of context aware monoids. We will examine these type classes in later chapters of this course.

### The `Array` instance

Arrays in terms of monoids are pretty much self-explanatory:

```javascript
// Monoid

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const arrPrepend = ys => xs =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const arrEmpty = () => [];

// MAIN

arrAppend([1, 2, 3]) ([4, 5, 6]); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

arrPrepend([1, 2, 3]) ([4, 5, 6]); // [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]

arrAppend([1, 2, 3]) (arrEmpty()); // [1, 2, 3]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/FatalWindingLight)

They represent the aggregating notion of monoidal computations.

### The `Pred` instance

The predicate function instance is a bit more interesting:

```javascript
// record constructor

const record = (type, o) =>
  (o[type.name || type] = type.name || type, o);

// PRED

const Pred = pred => record(Pred, {pred});

// Monoid

const predAppend = tp => tq =>
  Pred(x => tp.pred(x) && tq.pred(x));

const predEmpty = () => Pred(_ => true);

// auxiliary functions

const numLte_ = y => x => x <= y;

const numGte_ = y => x => x >= y;

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

// predicate function

const numBetween = (x, y) => predAppend(
  Pred(numLte_(y)))
    (Pred(numGte_(x)));

// MAIN

const main = predAppend(
  numBetween(5, 10))
    (Pred(isEven));

main.pred(6); // true
main.pred(7); // false
main.pred(12); // false
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/AggravatingAquamarineSystemadministrator)

A predicate is an unary function wrapped in a `Pred` value to distinguish it from regular functions. Predicates are fixed in the type of their codomain, i.e. they always return a boolean. The `Monoid` instance let us compose simple predicates to build more complex ones. Please note that `Pred` represents the picking notion of monoids.

The `Pred` type seems to be just a simple object wrapper but adds type safety to our code, because we cannot use predicates in lieu of normal functions anymore or use them in a context, where booleans are meant to be combined with the `||` operator. Moreover it makes our code more declarative, because predicates are explicitly denoted.

### Defining multidimensional orderings

#### `Comparator` type

First we declare a comparator type to avoid using Javascript's ordering protocoll `1`/`0`/`-1`. It happens that `Comparator` forms a monoid:

```javascript
// union constructor

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

// COMPARATOR

const Comparator = union("Comparator");

const LT = Comparator("LT", {valueOf: () => -1});

const EQ = Comparator("EQ", {valueOf: () => 0});

const GT = Comparator("GT", {valueOf: () => 1});

// Monoid

const ctorAppend = tx => ty => 
  match(tx, {
    LT: _ => LT,
    EQ: _ => ty,
    GT: _ => GT
  });

const ctorEmpty = () => EQ;
```
#### The `Compare` instance

`Compare` is a binary function type that returns values of type `Comparator`. Since comparators are monoids this means we can combine them to form multidimensional orderings:

```javascript
// COMPARE

const Compare = cmp => record(
  Compare,
  {cmp});

// Monoid

const cmpAppend = tx => ty =>
  Compare(x => y => ctorAppend(tx.cmp(x) (y)) (ty.cmp(x) (y)));

const cmpEmpty = () => _ => _ => ctorEmpty();

// auxiliary functions

const _let = f => f();

const isEven = x => (x & 1) === 0;

// Comparator functions

const byNatural = Compare(x => y =>
  x < y ? LT
    : x > y ? GT
    : EQ);

const byEven = Compare(x => y =>
  isEven(x) && !isEven(y) ? GT
    : !isEven(x) && isEven(y) ? LT
    : EQ);

// MAIN

const xs = [4, 8, 2, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1, 7, 0];

xs.sort(
  (x, y) =>
   cmpAppend(byEven)
     (byNatural).cmp(x) (y)); // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8];
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/ImpartialInvolvedProgrammingmacro)

Since `Compare` is also a monoid, we can combine such wrapped functions even though each of them expects two arguments. Ultimately this means we can compose binary functions with a fixed return type. Different variations of composition - this is where functional programming shines.

Please note that I used the built-in destructive sort method of Javascript, because I treat native `Array`s as a mutable data type. We coul have used a more general `sortBy` function though, which offers a more elegantly API.

### Semigroup lifting

There are some types that only form a semigroup but not a monoid. However, we can easily promote such types to monoids using the polymophic `optmAppend` and `optmEmpty` operations:

```javascript
// union constructor

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

// OPTION

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});

const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// FIRST

const First = first => record(First, {first});

// Semigroup

const fstAppend = tx => ty => tx; 

// lift into Monoid

const optmAppend = append => tx => ty =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => ty,

    Some: ({some: x}) => match(ty, {
      None: _ => tx,
      Some: ({some: y}) => Some(append(x) (y))
    })
  });

const optmEmpty = () => None;

// auxiliary function

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

// MAIN

const xs = [Some("foo"), Some("bar"), Some("baz")],
  ys = [None, Some("bar"), Some("baz")],
  zs = [];

const main = arrFold(
  optmAppend(fstAppend))
    (optmEmpty());

main(xs); // Some("foo")
main(ys); // Some("bar")
main(zs); // None
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/SphericalComplexPrinter)

Clearly `optmEmpty` plays the role of the missing identity element.

### Commutative monoids and `Dual`

While monoids have to be associative, they are not necessarily commutative, that is, for most `Monoid` instances the following applies:

`append(x) (y) !== append(y) (x)`

Consequently it makes sense to define an operation with flipped arguments. We can achieve this either by manually supplying both operations or by declaring a type that reverses the arguments programmatically:

```javascript
const record = (type, o) =>
  (o[type.name || type] = type.name || type, o);

const Dual = dual => record(Dual, {dual});

const dualAppend = append => tx => ty =>
  Dual(append(ty.dual) (tx.dual));

const dualEmpty = empty => () => Dual(empty());

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);
  
const arrEmpty = () => [];

const arrPrepend = dualAppend(arrAppend);

arrPrepend(
  Dual([1, 2, 3))
    (Dual([4, 5, 6])); // Dual([4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3])
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/HealthyGreenHack)

Obviously, `Dual` adds a certain noise to the calling site. For that reason I prefer the manual approach and declare both `append` and `prepend` operations for each type in the scriptum library.

### Monoid homomorphisms

If we have two types that both are monoids and there exists a function to transform one monoid into the other while the monoidal structure is preserved, this function is called a monoid homomorphism. As we have already learned the monoid structure consists of a binary operation and an identity element. Here are the equations that must hold for both properties. `hom` is the said transformation function:

```javascript
hom(append1(x) (y)) === append2(hom(x)) (hom(y))
hom(empty1) === empty2
```
Let us examine an example that has the above properties and one that does not.

#### `Array`/`Number` under addition

The `length` function is a monoid homomorphism between `Array` and `Number`, namely natural numbers to be more precisely:

```javascript
const arrEmpty = () => [];

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const sumEmpty = () => 0;

const sumAppend = x => y => x + y;

const length = xs => xs.length;

length(arrAppend([1, 2, 3]) ([4, 5])) ===
  sumAppend(length([1, 2, 3])) (length([4, 5])); // true
  
length(arrEmpty()) === sumEmpty(); // true
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/TestyViolentReference)

`length` meets the above criteria and is thus a valid monoid homomorphism.

#### `Task`/`Parallel`

`Task` represents asynchronous computations, which are processed in sequence. Its monoid instance lifts two normal values and combines them within an asynchronous computation using their corresponding monoid operation. The `Monoid` instance looks as follows:

```javascript
// TASK

const Task = task => record(
  Task,
  thisify(o => {
    o.task = (res, rej) =>
      task(x => {
        o.task = k => k(x);
        return res(x);
      }, rej);
    
    return o;
  }));

// Monoid

const taskAppend = append => tx => ty =>
  Task((res, rej) =>
    tx.task(x =>
      ty.task(y =>
        res(append(x) (y)), rej), rej));

const taskEmpty = empty =>
  () => Task((res, rej) => res(empty()));
```
`Parallel` represents asynchronous computations, which are processed in parallel. Its monoid instance picks the result value of the faster one of two asynchronous computations. It represents the race monoid so to speak. The `Monoid` instance looks as follows:

```javascript
// PARALLEL

const Parallel = par => record(
  Parallel,
  thisify(o => {
    o.par = (res, rej) =>
      par(x => {
        o.par = k => k(x);
        return res(x);
      }, rej);
    
    return o;
  }));

// primitive combinator

const parOr = tx => ty => {
  const guard = (res, rej) => [
    x => (
      isRes || isRej
        ? false
        : (isRes = true, res(x))),
    e =>
        isRes || isRej
          ? false
          : (isRej = true, rej(e))];

  let isRes = false,
    isRej = false;

  return Parallel(
    (res, rej) => (
      tx.par(...guard(res, rej)),
      ty.par(...guard(res, rej))));
};

// Monoid

const raceAppend = tx => ty =>
  Parallel((res, rej) =>
    parOr(tx) (ty)
      .par(x => res(x), rej));

const raceEmpty = () => Parallel((res, rej) => null);
```
Can we create an homomorphism between both monoids?

```javascript
const taskParallel = tx =>
  Parallel((res, rej) => tx.task(x => res(x), rej));
```
`taskParallel` seems to be a promising candidate, but does it preserve the monoidal structure?

```javascript
const delayTask = f => ms => x =>
  Task((res, rej) => setTimeout(comp(res) (f), ms, x));

const delayParallel = f => ms => x =>
  Parallel((res, rej) => setTimeout(comp(res) (f), ms, x));

const taskInc = delayTask(x => x + 1) (20);

const taskSqr = delayTask(x => x * x) (200);

const parInc = delayParallel(x => x + 1) (10);

const parSqr = delayParallel(x => x * x) (100);

const sumAppend = x => y => x + y;

const sumEmpty = () => 0;

parAppend(
  taskParallel(taskSqr(5)))
    (taskParallel(taskInc(5)))
      .par(console.log); // logs 6

taskParallel(
  taskAppend(sumAppend)
    (taskSqr(5))
      (taskInc(5)))
        .par(console.log); // logs 31
  
6 === 31; // false, does not preserve the structure
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/SelfreliantPristineMarketing)

No, it does not. `taskParallel` is not a monoid homomorphism but just a transformation from `Task` to `Parallel`.

### Several monoids per type

Scriptum uses directory passing style and hence can define several monoid instances per type. Consequently we can spare type wrappers in many cases and just use different prefixes for different instances:

```javascript
const allEmpty = () => true;
const anyEmpty = () => false;

const allAppend = x => y => x && y;
const anyAppend = x => y => x || y;
```
However, for some cases I will still use type wrappers, because it makes the code more declarative and more type safe:

```javascript
const Pred = pred => record(Pred, {pred});

const predEmpty = () => Pred(_ => true);

const predAppend = tp => tq =>
  Pred(x => tp.pred(x) && tq.pred(x));
```
