## Composing Effects with Monad Transformers

* lifting actions seems to be a big issue of transormers
* the innermost monad is called bottom
* every monad has a transformer
* transformers are point-free style
* Alternatives:
  * custom monad
  * continuation monad
* the outer monad does not know anything about the monad it is transforming
* the innermost monad determines the dominant semantics of the stack
* the order of a stack determines its semantics
* the interaction of two effects can be controlled by picking a specific stack order
* Either(List):  Each branch can fail separately
* List(Either): The whole non-deterministic computation can fail with a single error
* a monad without a transformer must be at the bottom of the stack
* be carefulwith ListT https://wiki.haskell.org/ListT_done_right
