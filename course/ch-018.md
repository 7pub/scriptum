## Composing Effects with Monad Transformers

Composing effects in a monadic way is tricky but also extremely powerful. In this chapter we will delve deep into the subject. Hang in there!

### Monads do not compose in general

While there are some monads of different type that do compose in a mechanical way this does not apply in general. As soon as you nest different monadic types into one another you will eventually run into compositions that behave in unexpected ways or even raise errors:

```
// mmx has type M<N<A>>

chain1(mmx) (mx => // M layer
  chain2(mx) (x => // N layer
    ...));
```
The problem lies in joining the different effect layers `M` and `N` for every possible monad. I am not going to show examples, because that would mean a considerable effort and would rather confuse than help. At this point we just have to accept this as fact.

### Higher order monads to the rescue

What are the consequences that monads of different type do not compose in general? It means we need to implement each and every composition by hand, because it is specific to the set of involved monads. This is not particularly satisfying. We probably end up writing a lot of `chain` and `of` functions with large portions of repetitive code. The goal is to write a composable monad instance once and than compose it with any possible monad, so that we have a 1-1 relation between normal monad instances and our composbale monad implementations. In order to achieve this we need a monad that takes another monad to create a new one - in other words a higher order monad. But what exactly constitutes a higher order monad at the term level? Well, just `chain` and `of` which each take `chain` and `of` from another monad as their first argument.

The monad passed to the higher order one is called the base monad. If we compose two monads of different type we get back a nested monad, where the base monad becomes the inner and the higher order monad becomes the outer one:

```javascript
// HOM = Higher Order Monad
// BM  = Base Monad

ofHOM(ofBM) // yields
valueBM(valueHOM)

chainHOM(chainBM) // finally yields
valueBM(valueHOM)
```
The higher order monad transforms the inner monad by combining the effects. For this reason higher order monads are referred to as monad transformers.

### Monad transformer stacks

A monad transformer that takes a base monad returns a new monad, which in turn can be passed to another monad transformer. According to this principle we can compose several monads which figuratively speaking form a monad transformer stack. Please note that the transformer stack we are going to build in the following sections is rather contrived. I want you to solely focus on the mechanics of the effect composition rather than on the question if a particularly transformer stack is useful in practice.

#### `EffT`/`Array`

We start with a computation with two effects,

* a deferring
* and non-deterministic one

We use the `EffT` monad transformer that takes the `Array` monad to encode the monadic composition:

```javascript
// record constructor

const record = (type, o) =>
  (o[type.name || type] = type.name || type, o);

// common combinators

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

// EFFECT

const Eff = eff =>
  record(Eff, {get eff() {return eff()}});

// Monad

const effOf = x => Eff(() => x);

const effChain = mx => fm =>
  Eff(() => fm(mx.eff).eff);

// Monad Transformer

const effOfT = of => x => of(Eff(() => x));

const effChainT = ({map, chain, of}) => mmx => fmm =>
  chain(mmx) (mx =>
    Eff(() => map(my => my.eff) (fmm(mx.eff))));

const effLiftT = of => fm =>
  comp(of) (fm);

// ARRAY

// Functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// Monad

const arrChain = mx => fm =>
  arrFold(acc => x =>
    arrAppend(acc) (fm(x))) ([]) (mx);

const arrOf = x => [x];

// auxiliary functions

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  xs.concat(ys);

// ARREFF

// Monad

const arrEffChain = effChainT(
  {map: arrMap, chain: arrChain, of: arrOf});

const arrEffOf = effOfT(arrOf);

// auxiliary functions

const arrEffFilter = p => arrEffChain(mmx) (x =>
  p(x)
    ? [effOf(x)]
    : []);

const arrEffTake = n => xs =>
  Eff(() => {
    const go = i => acc => {
      if (acc.length === n || xs.length === i)
        return acc;

      else {
        const ys = xs[i].eff;

        return ys.length === 0
          ? go(i + 1) (acc)
          : go(i + 1) (acc.concat(ys));
      }
    };

    return go(0) ([]);
  });

// MAIN

const randomNum = Eff(
  () => (
    console.log("eval"), // A
    Math.round(Math.random() * 100)));

const mmx = [randomNum, randomNum, randomNum, randomNum, randomNum];

const main = arrEffTake(3)
  (arrEffFilter(x => (x & 1) === 0));

// no effects yet...

main.eff; // logs eval x-times and yields up to three even random numbers
```

The deferring `Eff` effect is used to separate impure synchronous computations from the pure realm of your program. The trick is that `Eff` computations are wrapped in a thunk and thus only describe computations, which will only be evaluated at a later time. Since `Eff` forms a monad we can compose descriptions of computations and pretend they are purely functional.

Now that we better understand `Eff`'s semantics we can comprehend what is happening in the example above. First we construct the `ArrEff` monad by passing `arrChain` and `arrOf` to the `EffT` monad transformer functions. Then we fill an array with five descriptions of how to generate a pseudo random number. Next we filter the even pseudo random numbers and take up to three of them or more precisely, we write descriptions how to filter and take up to three descriptions of how to generate pseudo random numbers. At this point the non-deterministic effect kicks in, because we do not know upfront how many even numbers we will collect.

Line `A` proves that no effect is performed unless we access `main.eff`. `Eff` abstracts from the thunk interface through an object getter, hence we can drop the parenthesis in `main.eff()`. Depending on how many even pseudo random numbers are generated until we reach three `eval` is logged x-times and the array of numbers is returned. `Eff` is an thrilling type, because it actually comprises two different type. In the pure realm of our example it has type `[Eff]`, while is has `[number]` in the impure one. Both types correspond to the present and the future.

The good thing about `EffT` is that we can combine it with any other monad. During this section we are going to build a monad transformer stack, though. Let us add the effect of computations that may have no result.

#### `OptionT`/`EffT`/`List`

#### `OptionT`/`EffT`/`ListT`/`Tramp`

* adding stack-safety to your new monad

Wait, what?

### Illegal monad transformers

#### `ArrayT`/`Option` done wrong

#### `ArrayT`/`Option` done right

### Effects are not commutative

### Where are the type wrappers?

### Explicit versus implicit lifting

### Alternative approaches

#### Pre-composed monads

* one transformer fits all effects style

#### Continuation monad encodings

#### Outlook on more advanced alternatives

* the transformer is a function that transforms a base monad, which is thus the transormed monad
* even though a transformer are just two functions `chainT` and `ofT`, it is hard to generalize the composition of a single monad
