## Data Modelling with Algebraic Data Types (GADTs)

I have found it rather hard to get further information about how to model your domain in functional programming than merely the reference to GADTs. This chapter is an attempt to give you a rough idea.

### Product types

### Sum types

#### Pattern matching

### Other GADTs

#### Void type

#### Unit type

#### Lazy types

### The algebra of GADTs

### From product types to hierarchical data and invariants

### Sums of products
