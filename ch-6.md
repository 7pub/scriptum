## Data Modelling with Algebraic Data Types (GADTs)

I have found it rather hard to get further information about how to model your domain in functional programming than merely the reference to GADTs. This chapter is an attempt to give you a rough idea.

### GADTs

Algebraic data types are composable and may have a recursive definition. It is not a coincidence that both properties, composition and recursion, are also applied to the type level. They are ubiquitous in the functional paradigm. The next sections will introduce the basic GADTs, which can be composed to more complex composite types.

### Sum types

#### Pattern matching

### Product types

### Other GADTs

#### Void type

#### Unit type

#### Lazy types

### The algebra of GADTs

### From product types to hierarchical data and invariants

### Sums of products
