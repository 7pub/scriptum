## From Tail Recursion over Trampolining to Corecursion

### The structure of recursive implementations

### Body and tail recursion

### Natural or structural recursion

### Tail call and CPS transformation

### Indirect or mutual recursion

### Anonymous recursion

### Compiler/Interpreter optimization strategies

### From trampolines to fully-fledged evaluators

### Corecursion

### Co-/Recursion as a last resort
