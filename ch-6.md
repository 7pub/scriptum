## Functional Data Modelling with Algebraic Data Types

### Data dependencies

* explicit
* as opposed to function dependencies
* read after write
* the program flow is defined by the data dependencies and not by the sequence of instructions.

#### Dependency injection

### General Algebraic Data Types (GADT)

* composite type
* product type (tuples/records)
* sum type (tagged union)
* product type has fields
* sum type has variants
* 

### Javascript Encoding
