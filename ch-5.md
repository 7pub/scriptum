## Lazy Evaluation and WHNF in a Strictly Evaluated Setting

Lazy evaluation in the strict sense means that expressions are only evaluated

* when needed
* at leftmost outermost level
* once

### Lazy through explicit thunks

### Lazy through functions and ETA abstractions

### Lazy through transparent thunks and WHNF

### Lazy through continuation passing style

### Lazy through streams

### Sharing of once computed expressions
