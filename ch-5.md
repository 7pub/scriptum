## Lazy Evaluation and WHNF in a Strictly Evaluated Setting

Lazy evaluation in the strict sense means that expressions are only evaluated

* when needed
* at the leftmost, outermost level
* once

In this chapter, however, I will use the term in a broader, less technical sense. Lazy is every mechanism that somehow suppresses the immediate evaluation of expressions.

#### Normal order

#### WHNF

#### Sharing

### Lambda abstractions

### Nullary functions

### Thunks

#### Infinite recursion

#### Value recursion

#### Forcing evaluation
