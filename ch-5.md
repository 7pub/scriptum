## Lazy Evaluation and WHNF in a Strictly Evaluated Setting

Lazy evaluation in the strict sense means that expressions are only evaluated

* when needed
* at the leftmost, outermost level
* once

In this chapter, however, I will use the term in a broader, less technical sense. Lazy is every mechanism that somehow suppresses the immediate evaluation of expressions.

### Lazy through explicit thunks

### Lazy through functions and ETA abstractions

### Lazy through transparent thunks and WHNF

### Lazy through continuation passing style

### Lazy through streams

### Sharing of once computed expressions
